tactics have a tendency to go in and out of style broken link building is one such tactic it was once a convenient scalable tool in a link builders toolbox but then folks started saying it wasnt as effective as guest posting which you know is supposed to be dead in its own right the reality of course is somewhere in the middle a modern comprehensive link building strategy requires a variety of different tactics to achieve your goals when used appropriately broken link building still rocks its scalable reliable and should be a staple you turn to when you need to put together a link building strategy time has changed how an seo should go about building broken links though heres what you need to know to successfully build broken links today a broken link is a link on a website that no longer leads to the content that its supposed to be referencing instead you get one of these big unpleasant 404 graphics:  a broken link can happen in a myriad of ways the website might have made a mistake when linking to outside content for example or the linked website has removed the page in question the big issue with this is that broken links hinder the user experience for anyone browsing your website in fact too many broken links can even hinder the linking sites seo that is where broken link building comes into play with any sort of link building an seo has to ask themselves this question: why is this site better off by including the link that im asking for when it comes to broken link building that question is extremely easy to answer by pointing out a broken link to a webmaster and offering a convenient replacement youre providing value youre helping the webmaster improve their site quality and making their lives easier in theory at least the circumstance mentioned above is fairly idyllic and to be fair if youre dealing with a new webmaster or one servicing a website that doesnt generate a massive amount of traffic it might actually be that easy however the vast majority of webmasters see requests like this all the time they know the game thats being played and that means broken link building is harder than ever before luckily the process of finding broken links isnt all that hard in fact its one of the reasons so many people tout broken link building for its scalability there are a variety of different ways to look for broken links the most straightforward method would be to start by running backlink checks on websites and competitors in your niche lets look at hubspotcom as an example hubspot is an awesome resource for marketing information  but more importantly theyre also a popular website that will give you an idea of how broken links can be found  using ahrefs as our broken link checker we can look at every 404 that currently exists on hubspot and not only that a tool like ahrefs provides information on which pages are currently linking to these broken pages if youre running a marketing website and had a piece on the buyers journey for example you now have 172 leads to go after broken links the fun doesnt stop there either its a pretty good bet that those 172 sites care about marketing right so you can also check to see if they have any broken links that you could pursue as well see why this strategy is so great for scaling theres another conventional method for finding broken links: scraping resource pages with this method an seo uses advanced search terms in google or another search engine to find resource pages relevant to their niche so what does that look like in practice lets say youre trying to promote a marketing website you would type things like this into google: from there you pursue the serp results that look promising and manually check that all the resources they list have working links if you come across a broken link toss it into ahrefs or a similar tool to see who else might be linking to the broken page heres what finding broken links looks like in action if we enter marketing intitle:resources into google we get the following serp:  that 50 content marketing resources link looks promising there has to be a decent chance that one of their links no longer works right  clicking on this we found that the blue glass one is broken:  checked ahrefs: 12 referring domains including a really nice link from moz finding these links is easy nowadays there are plenty of backlink tools that can show you which websites are referring to broken pages to name a few: but now weve reached the hard part  asking a webmaster to replace a broken link with one to your own website outreach is difficult no matter what link building strategy youre using however thats actually one of the advantages of broken link building in theory helping a webmaster to identify broken links and fix them is something that could help you to establish a working relationship by being helpful and sincere they might be more willing to help you out and add your link in reality oftentimes link builders take the scalability of broken link building a bit too far theyll send out emails that look like this: hello webmaster my name is  and im an avid fan of your website insert url here however i came across a broken link today that i thought you might like to know about the link is in this post insert page here and heres the anchor text in question  i actually have a similar guide you could use if you wanted to replace the link heres the link to my version: insert your own link here thank you link builder now is that necessarily bad no the main advantage of this email is that you can use it as a template and really speed up the process of your outreach it even includes some spots where you can customize the email to suit the webmaster youre reaching out to the problem however is that webmasters get requests like this all the time especially if youre trying to reach out to a popular blog or website if theyve seen this tactic before they know the game they know youre in it for a link and not their websites success and so the success rate of these templates falls dramatically so what should you do its easy to start thinking too clinically with outreach as if youre attempting to make a transaction but thats just not a winning formula for link building strive to be affable and easy to work with while also providing webmasters with a reason to work with you broken link building is still a fantastic tool for earning meaningful links in fact it even has significant advantages over link building staples like guest posting and as long as you use it in the correct manner you will see results dont assume that simply having a replacement resource will be enough though webmasters get emails and pitches all the time for you to stand out in their inbox you need to communicate quickly effectively and give them a reason to work with you the best way to do that is to lean into your own personality to make your emails friendly helpful and approachable the longer you work at it the more youll improve all forms of link building take some trial and error the nice thing about it though is that you can track what emails work the best over time you can change your style to generate even more wins timeframe:Â monthly results detected:Â 412 months average links sent per month:Â 6 tools needed: benefits of broken link building: image credits featured image: paulo

competitors acquire links from you can find opportunities to build relationships with people relevant to business even if you are not invested in link building tools like semrush ahrefs and majestic arguably provide the greatest insight into competitor performance available outside of their own google analytics data link building is tough fortunately competitive link analysis can provide a roadmap available for you anything you can do i can do better competitive link analysis involves the use of highly sophisticated software to uncover competitor backlink data link builders sort this data by opportunity to find websites that are likely to link to their website there are really two ways to approach competitive link building: competitive link analysis involves a lot of manual outreach and typically have different success rates depending on the nature of the link link builders can also uncover other link building strategies to replicate in their own campaigns including: theres a reason that competitor link analysis is often the first strategy conducted by many link builders depending on the industry vertical some business will have to rely more heavily on resource content or their products for link building discovering how competitors have compiled links in a given industry provides a roadmap moving forward to increase ones organic visibility online chances are if a website has linked to a similar piece of content in the past it will do so again not only are these links easier to acquire but the links themselves should be highly relevant furthermore these websites can provide business opportunities moving forward discover partnerships and other relationships that your competition has formed and reach out to begin planting your own seed finally competitive link analysis can be a valuable strategy for filling the keyword gaps between you and the competition by understanding what pages have a high correlation between keyword rank and backlinks seo strategists can assess whether building links to a certain page or not justifies its budget using your preferred software program you can extract competitor backlink data and download it as a csv for this example we used a local based client with a specialized trade to get started we needed to look at their competitors to even know where to look  semrush provides important information such as anchor text the date it was first indexed and the status of the url code ahrefs provides the most comprehensive link analysis tool allowing webmasters to organize data by the total volume of backlinks and unique referring domains separately  export the csv from either of these programs and upload it to google sheets depending on the client you may have thousands of backlinks to pour through to help make organization easier you can filter your spreadsheet by link type domain rating or traffic for initial opportunities once you find links that are relevant to your business you need to gather the contact information for outreach  when organizing your spreadsheet and using your tools youll notice that certain urls will tend to attract more links than others analyze these landing pages and the referring links to see what value they provide for the referring landing pages these pages will also tend to have higher keyword rankings and be featured prominently on other channels such as social media work with your content and design team to create new and compelling content that serves as a better resource ideas include: once content is created its time for the tedious process of manual outreach when composing an email it pays to be courteous and straight to the point for example an email template could explain how that domain is linking to a dead link and that this impedes upon user experience and could even affect their own sites rankings on the other hand if youre trying to replace a link to live content your email pitch will need to be more persuasive most webmasters are skeptical of link building so offering a product at a cheaper price or a better resource often wont be enough some additional ideas for persuasion include: once you send out the initial email its time to sit back and wait its always good practice to follow up in a week or two if you dont receive a response depending on your email template and your underlying strategy results may vary timeframe:

news in the industry want to reap the full benefits of your link building efforts tackle technical seo first heres what you can do before an offsite link building campaign when you consider a link building campaign you may not be completely reaping the benefits of your seo efforts if you ignore technical seo the best results happen when you consider all the points of your websites seo: in fact there are situations when you must tackle technical seo before ever thinking about getting links if your website is weak in technical seo areas or extremely confusing for search engines it wont perform as well regardless of the quality and quantity of backlinks you have your top goals with technical seo is to make sure that your site is: these five points illustrate why its important to tackle technical seo before link building if your site is unable to be crawled or is otherwise deficient in technical seo best practices you may suffer from poor site performance the following chapter discusses why and how you should be tackling technical seo before starting a link building campaign if you have recently made the jump to an https secure implementation you may not have had the chance to audit or otherwise identify issues with your secure certificate installation a surfacelevel audit at the outset can help you identify any major issues affecting your transition to https major issues can arise later on when the purchase of the ssl certificate did not initially take into account what the site would be doing later one thing to keep in mind is that you must take great care in purchasing your certificate and making sure it covers all the subdomains you want it to if you dont you may end up with some issues as a result such as not being able to redirect urls if you dont get a full wildcard certificate and you have url parameters on a subdomain  using absolute urls  that your certificate doesnt cover you wont be able to redirect those urls to https: this is why it pays to be mindful of the options you choose during the purchase of your ssl certificate because it can negatively affect your site later its easy to create an https secure implementation with errant redirects for this reason an eagle eyes view of the sites current redirect states will be helpful in correcting this issue it can also be easy to create conflicting redirects if you dont keep watch on the redirects you are creating in addition its easy to let redirects run out of control and lead to tens or many more redirects per site url in turn leads to bogging down site performance the easiest way to fix this issue moving forward: make sure that your redirects are all created in a 1:1 ratio you should not have 1015 or more redirect urls per url on your site if you do something is seriously wrong  the correct implementation is that one should redirect to the other not both if you have both of them loading at the same time something is wrong with the secure version of your site if you type in your sites urls into your browser try and test https: and http: separately if both urls load you are displaying two versions of your content and duplicate urls can lead to duplicate content issues to make sure that you do not run into this issue again you will want to do one of the following depending on your sites platform: instead this is an example of exactly what we want to display to users and search engines: you can perform global redirects at the server level in htaccess on apache  cpanel servers inmotionhosting has a great tutorial on how to force this redirect on your own web host but for our purposes well focus on the following ones to force all web traffic to use https this is the following code you will want to use you want to make sure to add this code above any code that has a similar prefix rewriteengine on rewritecond etc rewriteengine onrewritecond https onrewritecond requesturi 09cpaneldcvrewritecond requesturi wellknownpkivalidationaf0932txt: comodo dcvrewriterule  https:httphostrequesturi lr301 if you want to redirect only a specified domain you will want to use the following lines of code in your htaccess file: rewritecond requesturi 09cpaneldcvrewritecond requesturi wellknownpkivalidationaf0932txt: comodo dcvrewriteengine onrewritecond httphost examplecom ncrewritecond serverport 80rewriterule  https:wwwexamplecom1 r301l dont forget to change any urls in the above examples to what is the correct implementation on your domain name there are other solutions in that tutorial which may work for your site warning: if you do not have confidence in your abilities to make the correct changes at the server level on your server please make sure to have your server companyit person perform these fixes for you you can screw up something major with these types of redirects if you do not know exactly what you are doing  the easiest way to fix these redirect issues especially if you operate a wordpress site is to just use a plugin there are many plugins that can force http: to https: redirects but here are a few that will help make this process as painless as possible: caution about plugins  dont just add another plugin if youre already using too many plugins you may want to investigate if your server can use similar redirect rules mentioned above such as if you are using an nginxbased server it must be stated here: plugin weight can affect site speed negatively so dont always assume that the latest plugin will help you even if you perform the redirects above you should perform this step this is especially true if you are using absolute urls as opposed to relative urls where the former always displays the hypertext transfer protocol that youre using if you are using the latter this is less important and you probably dont need to pay much attention to this why do you need to change links onsite when you are using absolute urls because google can and will crawl all of those links and this can result in duplicate content issues it seems like a waste of time but its really not you are making sure the end result is that google sees exactly the site you want them to see one version one set of urls one set of content no confusion  a sudden spike in 404s can make your site almost impossible to crawl especially if the links between http: and https: pages exist difficulty crawling a site is one of the most common issues that can result from a spike in 404s also crawl budget wasted due to too many 404s showing up and google not finding pages that it should why this impacts site performance and why it matters: while john mueller of google mentions that crawl budget doesnt matter except for extremely large sites: googles john mueller said on twitter that he believes that crawl budget optimization is overrated in his mind he said for most sites it doesnt make a difference and that it only can help really massive sites john wrote imo crawlbudget is overrated most sites never need to worry about this its an interesting topic and if youre crawling the web or running a multibillionurl site its important but for the average site owner less so he added a great article by yauhen khutarniuk head of seo at seo powersuite puts this perfectly: quite logically you should be concerned with crawl budget because you want google to discover as many of your sites important pages as possible you also want it to find new content on your site quickly the bigger your crawl budget and the smarter your management of it the faster this will happen its important to optimize for crawl budget because finding new content on your site quickly should be the priority while discovering as many of your sites high priority pages as possible primarily you want to redirect any 404s from the old url to the new existing url check out benj arriolas search engine journal article for more information on 404s vs soft 404s and how to fix them one of the easier ways especially if you have a wordpress site would be to crawl the site with screaming frog and perform a bulk upload of your 301 redirect rules using the redirection wordpress plugin otherwise you may have to create redirect rules in htaccess the structure of your urls is an important consideration when getting your site ready for technical seo you must pay attention to things like randomly generating dynamic parameters that are being indexed urls that are not easy to understand and other factors that will cause issues with your technical seo implementation these are all important factors because they can lead to indexation issues that will hurt your sites performance when you create urls you likely think about where the content is going and then you create urls automatically this can hurt you however the reason why is because automatically generated urls can follow a few different formats none of which are very humanreadable for example: none of these formats that you encounter are very human readable are they the reason why its important is that communicating the content behind the url properly is a large part of user intent its even more important today also because of accessibility reasons the more readable your urls are the better: many existing sites may be using outdated or confusing url structures leading to poor user engagement identifying which urls can be more human readable can create better user engagement across your site one important technical seo consideration that should be ironed out before any link building is duplicate content when it comes to duplicate content issues these are the main causes: this can hurt because it does confuse search engines when more than one url represents one piece of content search engines will rarely show the same piece of content twice and not paying attention to duplicate urls dilutes their ability to find and serve up each duplicate while dynamic parameters are in and of themselves not a problem from an seo perspective if you cannot manage your creation of them and get consistent in their use this can become a significant problem later jes scholz has an amazing article on search engine journal covering the basics of dynamic parameters and url handling and how it can affect seo if you are not familiar with dynamic parameters i suggest reading her article asap before proceeding with the rest of this section scholz explains that parameters are used for the following purposes: when you get to the point that your urls dynamic parameters are causing a problem it usually comes down to basic mismanagement of the creation of these urls in the case of tracking using many different dynamic parameters when creating links that search engines crawl in the case of reordering using these different dynamic parameters to reorder lists and groups of items that then create indexable duplicate pages that search engines then crawl you can inadvertently trigger excessive duplicate content issues if you dont keep your dynamic parameters to a manageable level you should never need 50 urls with utm parameters to track the results of certain types of campaigns the creation of these dynamic urls for one piece of content can really add up over time if you arent carefully managing their creation and will dilute the quality of your content along with its capability to perform in search engine results it leads to keyword cannibalization and on a large enough scale can severely impact your ability to compete a longheld seo best practice has been shorter urls are better than longer urls googles john mueller has discussed this: what definitely plays a role here is when we have two urls that have the same content and we try to pick one to show in the search results we will pick the short one so that is specifically around canonicalization it doesnt mean it is a ranking factor but it means if we have two urls and one is really short and sweet and this other one has this long parameter attached to it and we know they show exactly the same content we will try to pick the shorter one there are lots of exceptions there different factors that come into play but everything else being equal  you have a shorter one and a longer one we will try to pick the shorter one there is also empirical evidence that shows that google ranks shorter urls for more terms rather than long and specific if your site contains super long urls everywhere you may want to optimize them into better shorter urls that better reflect the articles topic and user intent  site glitches and other problems can arise when your site is not coded correctly these glitches can result from badlynested div tags resulting in a glitched layout code with bad syntax resulting in calltoaction elements disappearing and bad site management resulting in the careless implementation of onpage elements crossplatform compatibility can be affected along with page speed resulting in greatly reduced performance and user engagement long before link building ever becomes a consideration nip some of these issues in the bud before they become major problems later many of these technical seo issues come down to poor site management and poor coding the more that you tackle these technical seo issues at the beginning with more consistent development and website management best practices the better off youll be later when your link building campaign takes off when you have a poorly coded site design your user experience and engagement can suffer and will be adversely affected this is yet another element of technical seo that can be easily overlooked a poorly coded site design can manifest in several ways with: any of these issues can spell disaster for your site when it cant properly report on capture leads or engage with users to its fullest potential this is why these things should always be considered and tackled onsite before moving to link building if you dont you may wind up with weaknesses in your marketing campaigns that will be even harder to pin down or worse  you may never find them all of these elements of a site design must be addressed and otherwise examined to make sure that they are not causing any major issues with your seo since july 2018 google rolled out page speed as a ranking factor in its mobile algorithm to all users slow loading pages can affect everything so its something that you should pay attention to on an ongoing basis and not just for rankings but for all of your users also what should you be on the lookout for when it comes to issues that impact page speed if your site has many images approaching 1 mb 1 megabyte in file size you have a problem as the average internet connection speed approaches over 2722 mbps download on mobile and fixed broadband approaches over 5960 mbps download realistically this becomes less of an issue but can still be an issue you will still face slower loading pages when you have such large images on your site if you use a tool like gtmetrix you can see how fast your site loads these images typical page speed analysis best practices say that you should take three snapshots of your sites page speed average out the three snapshots and thats your sites average page speed it is recommended on average for most sites that images should be at most 35  50k per image not more this is depending on resolution and pixel density including whether you are accommodating the higher pixel densities of iphones and other devices also use lossless compression in graphics applications like adobe photoshop in order to achieve the best quality possible while resizing images some people believe that standard coding best practices say that you should be using w3c valid coding googles webmaster guidelinesÂ recommend using valid w3c coding to code your site  but john mueller and even matt cutts have mentioned in the past that its not critical to focus on w3cvalid coding for ranking reasons search engine journal staff roger montti discusses this conundrum in even further detail here: 6 reasons why google says valid html matters but thats the key word there focusing on it for ranking purposes you will find at the top of google for different queries all sorts of websites that ascribe to different coding best practices and not every site validates via the w3c despite a lack of focus on that type of development best practice for ranking purposes there are plenty of reasons why using w3c valid coding is a great idea and why it can put you ahead of your competitors who are not doing it before any further discussion takes place it needs to be noted from a developer perspective: but in the end which is better and why picking a coding standard being consistent with your coding best practices and sticking with them is generally better than not when you pick a coding standard and stick with it you introduce less complexity and less of a chance that things can go wrong after the final site launch while some see w3cs code validator as an unnecessary evil it does provide rhyme and reason to making sure that your code is valid for example if your syntax is invalid in your header or you dont selfclose tags properly w3cs code validator will reveal these mistakes if during development you transferred over an existing wordpress theme from say xhml 10 to html 5 for server compatibility reasons you may notice thousands of errors it means that you have incompatibility problems with the doctype in the theme and the language that is actually being used this happens frequently when someone copies and pastes old code into a new site implementation without regard to any coding rules whatsoever this can be disastrous to crossplatform compatibility also this simple check can help you reveal exactly whats working or not working under the hood right now codewise where efficient coding best practices come into play is doing things like inadvertently putting multiple closing div tags where they shouldnt go being careless about how you code the layout etc all of these coding errors can be a huge detriment to the performance of your site both from a user and search engine perspective plugins can become major problems when their use is not kept in check why is this how can this be  arent plugins supposed to help in reality if you dont manage your plugins properly you can run into major site performance issues down the line here are some reasons why all files that load on your site generate requests from the server or http requests every time someone requests your page all of your page elements load images video graphics plugins everything and all of these elements require an http request to be transferred the more http requests you have the more these extra plugins will slow down your site this can be mostly a matter of milliseconds and for most websites does not cause a huge issue it can however be a major bottleneck if your site is a large one and you have hundreds of plugins keeping your plugin use in check is a great idea to make sure that your plugins are not causing a major bottleneck and causing slow page speeds wordpress uses sql databases in order to process queries and maintain its infrastructure if your site is on wordpress its important to know that every plugin you add will send out extra database queries these extra queries can add up and cause bottleneck issues that will negatively affect your sites page speed the more you load plugins up the slower your site will get if you dont manage the database queries well you can run into serious issues with your websites performance and it will have nothing to do with how your images load it also depends on your host if you suffer from a large website with too many plugins and too little in the way of resources now may be the time for an audit to see exactly whats happening when the right plugins are used you dont have to worry much about keeping an eye on them you should however be mindful of when plugins are usually updated and how they work with your wordpress implementation to make sure your website stays functional if you autoupdate your plugins you may have an issue one day where a plugin does not play nice with other plugins this could cause your site to crash this is why it is so important to manage your wordpress plugins and make sure that you dont exceed what your server is capable of many technical seo issues can rear their ugly head and affect your sites serp performance long before link building enters the equation thats why its important to tackle technical seo before you start link building any technical seo issues can cause significant drops in website performance long before link building ever becomes a factor start with a thorough technical seo audit to reveal and fix any onsite issues it will help identify any weaknesses in your site and these changes will all work together with link building to create an even better online presence for you and your users any link building will be for

the latest news in the industry heres how to create content that catches the attention of influencers in your niche and entices them to engage with your content like never before who doesnt like a little ego boost when it comes to attracting highquality links to your website it may feel like you have tried everything in the book from mammoth evergreen content to good ol cold outreach if you are running out of ideas or simply arent seeing the results that you want it may be time to get creative fortunately theres a link building strategy that relies more on human psychology than it does seo technique enter ego bait content  a smart imaginative way to both attract quality links and generate new leads for your business heres how to create content that catches the attention of influencers in your niche and entices them to engage with your content like never before as the name implies the success of ego bait content involves stroking the ego of whichever influencer or website owner you want a link from in a sense its content that says if i scratch your back youll scratch mine while many link building methods aim to create content that appeals to a wide audience ego bait takes a highly targeted more personal approach the key here is creating content that oriented around a specific person business or group of people ego bait content is an example of how human psychology and marketing can intertwine to bring in some pretty amazing and lucrative results influencers and website owners alike want to be recognized for their accomplishments products and skills by sharing these with your audience you inspire them to share your content with their own audience and even link to it from their website this content can take the form of commending them for their work including them in a best of post featuring them in an interview or anything else that says youre awesome heres why in fact there are many types of ego bait and the approach you take both depends on whose ego you are trying to bait and whether your goal is to generate backlinks leads or both the most important thing to keep in mind before jumping into creating ego bait content is that it should put the recipient  not link building  front and center while this may seem backward its just too easy to slip into the mindset of link building that aims to reach a wider audience in hopes of attracting as many links as possible successful ego bait content is personal focused and intentional thats why choosing the right type of ego bait content will depend on who you are trying to target the main types of ego bait content are: below is a quick summary of each type of ego bait content later on youll learn how to pick the right type of content for reaching your seo goals a featured interview is one of the best ways to get influencers to share and link back to your content interviews allow you to put them in the spotlight  which is a huge ego boost by taking the time to ask them questions highlight their expertise and share their story with your audience you build a relationship that encourages mutual benefit theyll be happy to share their own interview across social media and even link back to it from their own site interview content is also easy to put together simply reach out to the influencer or business owner to make sure that theyre on board send them a list of questions and then publish the questions and answers on your site no need to spend hours researching and writing a mammoth piece of content with this type of ego bait you can create quality content quickly and generate traffic and links potentially overnight much like interviews roundup posts feature experts in your industry and share their expertise or stories with your audience the difference here is that a roundup post features several influencers and typically includes shorter quotes rather than extensive interview questions when creating a roundup post youll first want to think of a topic thats of interest to your audience for example if you are a family law attorney you may want to call on experts that help people cope with divorce such as psychologists motivational speakers and authors then you will build out a piece of content that allows the participants to share their top tips or stories on the topic for the example above that could be 10 experts share how to get over a divorce or how these 8 divorcees found love again once published youll want to reach out to participants to encourage them to share the post and link to it from their own content a listicle or list article is a piece of content that typically highlights the best of for a certain niche or creates a comprehensive list of resources products or influencers for users to readbuyfollow an example of a listicle could be 10 best meditation apps 50 ways to grow your business in 2019 or sejs 140 top seo experts you should be following in 2019 these kinds of articles are highly informative and beneficial to users in an ego bait listicle you will be referring to multiple influencers or business owners in order to stroke their egos and get them to engage with your content the goal is to create content that they would feel honored to be featured in thats why your content should be wellresearched and irresistible again you will want to choose a topic thats of interest to your audience and will attract links from quality websites in your niche then youll reach out to webmasters before andor after you feature them to encourage them to share or link to your content believe it or not directories can be a type of ego bait content as well not only are directories helpful to users but theyre a way of highlighting other businesses in your industry directories can also be a great source of lead generation for your business for instance if you often generate business from local contractors you may want to create a directory of contractors in your local area that way you can build partnerships with these contractors and help them generate traffic through your directory then you can reap the rewards through referral business of course you may not want to give too much limelight to direct competitors so be careful in choosing who to feature in your directory its best to create a resource of businesses that will send leads your way and wont be put out by linking back to your website nothing is quite as enticing when it comes to ego bait as giving awards to those businesses you value the most awards can be an authentic way of calling attention to amazing organizations thought leaders and businesses in your industry to be effective as a link building strategy you will want to take the time to research each recipient and take note of what makes them unique highlight their years of experience how they have served their local community or the results they have gotten for their clients put them in the spotlight the award may be as simple as a featured post on your website or could include a customdesigned graphic to commemorate the moment just be sure that the award fits with what your business values and benefits the recipient as well note: dont use awards simply to generate a backlink most businesses will be able to see right through your efforts instead see it as an opportunity to grow your network and bring attention to businesses that are doing great work when executed correctly this type of ego bait content is likely to drive traffic to your website and even attract some backlinks in return once you familiarize yourself with the different types of ego bait content it will be easier to determine which type makes sense for your goals and the influencers you are trying to reach but before you get to writing its worth taking the time to create a list of contacts that you want to bait and developing a strategy on how you are going to generate shares links and leads as with any link building effort you want to be sure that you are targeting highquality nicherelated websites its not in your best interest to reach out to influencers or webmasters that will have no interest in your content or wont benefit your site in some way you will want to choose websites that are strong seowise high ranking high authority niche related and that have an audience that is likely to engage with your content you can use seo tools such as ahrefs and semrush to find websites that are worth targeting in your ego bait content some things to factor in are what keywords they are ranking for how much traffic they get whether their site is relevant to your industry and how authoritative their site is in the eyes of search engines once you have made a list of websites to reach out to you can move on to pick the topic of your content and the type of ego bait you want to create you should already recognize some trends and similarities in the websites you have included on your list this will help you determine which type of ego bait content will be most effective for instance if most of the websites on your list are those of industry experts you may want to create a series of interviews or build out a roundup post if however most of the websites are businesses sell products online or feature tools and apps it makes sense to create a listicle or directory to feature several websites at once next you will want to choose a topic that both makes sense for your own website and the websites you are targeting the topic should be of interest to your audience and enticing enough to encourage participants to link back to and share your content you may also want to do keyword research to make sure the topic is conducive to generating organic traffic by this point you should: depending on the type of content you chose you will want to reach out to those contacts in order to get more information from them this is also a way to break the ice and encourage them to link back to your content later on if you have decided to conduct an interview reach out to potential participants to confirm that they are onboard then follow up with the interview questions and collect their replies for roundup posts directories and listicles you may require additional information from participants this could include collecting their best tips for your chosen topic an image for their bio in your article or contact information for their business also its worth giving them a headsup on what the content piece is about when it will be published and how you would appreciate them engaging with your post this could be as simple as saying once the article comes out we would love it if you would share it with your audience or mention it on your website ego bait content is a form of content marketing so it makes sense that much of its success depends on the content itself if you are creating an interview or roundup much of the work will have already been done for you after you collect the responses from participants i also recommend including an engaging introduction some highquality images and short summary at the end other types of ego bait content will be more involved  requiring you to write much of the content yourself sourcing images or building out a directory because this content aims to serve multiple purposes its worth taking the time to do it right if you need help writing content or marketing your content consider hiring a professional content writer or content marketing expert to make your ego bait content topnotch if you gave participants a headsup before creating your content they should already be expecting you to follow up after the content is published this should be your final attempt at asking for a link or a share to help you out here is a simple email template to ask websites for backlinks and social shares: hey

want to build links faster try this nontraditional email outreach approach that can guarantee the highest response rate for each email you send email outreach has quite a prominent presence today it seems that nearly every business has heard of this link building strategy before even though the majority get it wrong about 100 of the time dont believe me then open your mailbox spam folder and read through all these email outreach gems for instance look at what i got only a few hours ago:  am i an expert in the finance niche absolutely not its no surprise that such emails mostly go straight to the spam folder but its astonishing how many emails never get any recipients attention at all recently brian dean teamed up with pitchbox to analyze 12 million outreach emails and one of their discoveries was that the average email response rate is 85 just think about it less than 10 of emails get a response with the vast majority of 90 remaining unanswered if you dont want your emails to add up to that pile its crucial to keep mastering your outreach techniques and explore new approaches in this post i want to do exactly that: show you a nontraditional email outreach approach that can guarantee the highest response rate for each email you send email outreach is one of those activities that has to be scalable which is impossible without templates and automation however to deserve your readers attention your emails must also be 100 authentic and personalized  all the things that dont work well with automation so whats the workaround for me its the nontraditional email outreach this approach relies on two main components: simply put nontraditional outreach means using original templates that are crafted in a unique way to represent your specific business not only does it guarantee a higher response rate but it also allows your emails to stand out and create a positive attitude towards your brand here are a few examples to back up my words: the guys from g2 placed a unique spin on their brand by offering a free 10 starbucks card in exchange for leaving a review on their site do you think this idea might work well for your business if so use this strategy as inspiration and adjust it for your business needs accordingly  when you hear robbies name the first thing that comes to mind is an expert roundup i had the honor of being invited to contribute to his most recent roundup where i shared my favorite wordpress seo plugins along with 49 other experts how did robbie pull this off all through email outreach lets deconstruct his approach to see exactly how it works to start off robbie reached out to wellknown experts that regularly contribute to their own and external blogs:  as a next step when the post goes live robbie asks the experts once again if they are willing to link back to it this approach allows him to get links faster since the experts are automatically motivated to share content to which they contributed all this would be impossible if the g2 and robbie richards started their outreach emails with hi  ive recently read your blog post and it was amazing link swap but besides avoiding standard templates overused by spammers and your competitors there are a few other steps that will empower your next outreach campaign: i know for a fact that things are much more complicated in reality this is especially so for companies that havent established any solid brand awareness within their niche yet a common question they have is where to start so that they dont encounter the scenario where all their outreach attempts are rejected in my agency we immerse solely in email outreach link building and this has resulted in the development of our own unique approach to this process hence i would like to share with you some tried and tested tactics that will help you acquire links in a few days and sometimes even hours the most timeconsuming part of the email outreach process is establishing trust but youre past that point when youre reaching out to people who already know you who are aware of your business and have a positive attitude towards it you can find those people in the following groups: there are several ways to find and engage with people with particular interests the system that i often use looks like this: heres how it works in a more elaborate way there are plenty of closed groups on facebook to accommodate to any interests whatsoever a big benefit of those groups is that they allow you to see the list of users that are members of that group even when youre not friends with themÂ so just search for groups within your niche and join them after this scan for users that are part of those groups and reach out to those who are also running blogs for their company use comments as an icebreaker find posts that have already gained a lot of attention in terms of engagement and leave a comment there after this you can write to users that were also leaving comments under this post and let them know that you have interacted with them before finally find out what they were sharing on their blogs or social media that youre also a big fan of cats and dogs horses or maybe burgers and craft beer this phase is truly timeconsuming but the results are really worth it excuse me what that was my reaction when i first found out that awkward emails are super effective but this idea is reinforced by psychologists who confirm that awkward or clumsy behavior is a wellknown conceptual move that helps them gain peoples trust much quicker however email outreach doesnt involve facetoface communication where you can drop a pen or spill a coffee so how exactly can you do that you can do this by telling your recipient a short story of your professional failings or purposely spell their name wrong and then fix it in the second sentence heres how i did it one time:  basically anything that makes them feel that a real human being is reaching out works another quick trick is to use custommade gifs about your life or even yourself once i used a gif of my horse to pitch content:  nontraditional email outreach involves putting a distinctive spin on the marketing of your business by using the three hacks mentioned above which are: you appeal to their human side which makes getting a response much more likely so get out there and craft your next big outreach email timeframe:

could also flip to the back of the book Â to the yellow pages  to search for local businesses now phone books are practically obsolete you search online for the product or service you need and when you include your location you can find a nearby shop within minutes this is exactly what you did with the phone book just without all the paper cuts according to google 80 of consumers in the us use search engines to find local businesses: consumers are searching for local information everywhere on every device at every point in the purchase process  what does this tell you you want your business to be found online  even if youre not seo savvy or if building links isnt in your wheelhouse dont worry theres a web directory for that online directories Â also known as business directories or business listings  are an easy way for businesses to build links and draw traffic to their site here are three benefits of using an online directory: directories typically index businesses by niche location or category and often include reviews when a person uses an online directory they want to locate a business that is relevant to their needs  to what theyre shopping for at that very moment a directory makes it very easy for consumers to cut through the marketing noise by having your business listed in a directory youre increasing your sites visibility which increases the chances of sales too  boosting your sites seo and rankings is a nice byproduct of having your business listed in an online directory online directories are trusted sources and are typically highranking sites themselves adding your link to an authority site seems like a nobrainer especially if it means improved visibility and reach and the possibility of improved seo and site rankings   many online directories  for example bing places yelp and foursquare  allow businesses to submit their information to their index for free some online directories on the other hand do charge a listing fee it may be worth it to add your business information to a paid directory though after all trusted highauthority links are a marketing investment  there are many types of online directories out there for example you can find general directories business listings local listings and niche directories choosing the directory  or directories  that you want to be listed on isnt like throwing spaghetti against the wall and seeing what sticks as with all other marketing tactics you need to have a strategy for link building on web directories here are a few things to consider when youre developing your strategy: relevance  and reaching your target audience  is crucial to getting the most out of an online directory relevance is also a factor that search engines consider when they crawl sites are you a travel agency in texas who specializes in road trips within the continental us then dont add your business to a listing for international travel sites it isnt relevant you wont reach your target audience and even if someone clicks on your link theyll only be frustrated to find that you dont offer international travel services if youre not an international travel business you dont want search engines to associate your website with international travel and yes that can hurt seo choose a directory that is relevant to your niche and the chances of reaching your target audience and boosting your seo will be much higher when youre deciding between online directories consider domain authority it can be more helpful to get an inbound link from a site with high domain authority but not always  learn more in the truth about domain authority: what every seo needs to understand you can check whether youre listing your business on a trusted wellestablished directory by checking the domain authority using a tool like ahrefs alexa or moz the higher the domain authority of a website the more likely it is to rank on serps so shoot for the stars  some online directories go into more detail than others and its up to you to decide whether you want a simple napw listing name address phone and web url or a listing that features photos reviews and ratings for the sake of reaching your target audience taking advantage of directories with more features will be worth the extra effort by listing your business on a directory with added features youll encourage your customers to provide feedback and ratings as well which is helpful to boost site authority and seo no matter which online directory you choose the key is to stay consistent with your information and updates if you list your business on more than one directory make sure that every bit of information  down to the last detail  is accurate onbrand and consistent across each listing not only is this crucial to the success of your link building strategy but its also important for the reputation of your business while the use of web directories may be easy to overlook in favor of other sexier marketing trends listing your business on a relevant online directory is one of the best Â and easiest  things you can do for your business and website timeframe: month 13 results detected: 412 months avg directories

founder loren baker about the latest news in the industry want to potentially get thousands of links from highquality sites be controversial heres why controversy gets links and how to do it right controversy gets links brands that understand their audience can take advantage ofÂ taking controversial stands if you know how your audience feels about a particular issue taking a stand on that issue only reinforces your brands relevance to your target customers brands like ben  jerrys patagonia heineken starbucks and many others have successfully parlayed arguably controversial social stands into thousands of links from highquality sites and the links have come from not only relevant sites that cater to the brands supporters but from highquality sites that cater to those opposed to the brands social positions in other words they get links from their supporters and their detractors a recent study by the public relations juggernaut edelman states that more than twothirds of worldwide consumers would buy or boycott a brand based on its social stance consumers are increasingly aware of brands social stances and they are acting based on their own beliefs the edelman study is conducted every year in the latest study 2018 the increase in consumers that cared about a brands social stance increased by 13 the highest increase in the history of the study more than half of the people surveyed in the study believed that brands play a more powerful role in social change than the government increasingly consumers are going to want to know what the social stance of a brand is and that will affect not only seo but sales and the bottom line obviously if your brand takes a stand the benefits or in the case of mistake fallout goes far beyond seo and link building but make no mistake: links flow to brands that are willing to stick their neck out and take a stand when i was a journalist the saying was if it bleeds it leads our job was to sell papers and we knew that a car wreck or an accident would make the papers fly off the shelf the same is true in todays modern journalism journalists look for brands to take stands  particularly bold stands  either hoping for a trainwreck or a triumph the journalist doesnt really care which as long as the clicks come in and the best links come from journalists and online influencers the saying i dont care what you say about me just spell my name right has never been truer than in the battle for highquality links in order to employ this tactic successfully you must know your audience if you dont know how your audience thinks you stand to lose a lot more than a decent search engine presence if your core audience turns on you because of a social stance you could lose your business im not just talking about merely understanding your audience demographics and buying patterns you need to understand: understanding your audience does not happen by following your intuition there is plenty of data out there to help you understand your audience from a macro level but if you can ask your audience directly what they think that is always the best think of yourself similar to a political pollster trying to figure out the issues that are important to your constituents because essentially thats what you are doing work to create a statistically valid sampling of your audience and poll them if you must incentivize the audience to tell you what they think do it understand incentivizing can skew results so best to hire someone who knows what they are doing when it comes to polling if you can afford to if you dont understand your audience dont take a stand period just ask the folks at the susan g komen race for the cure who are still recovering from their controversial decision to stop funding planned parenthood almost a decade ago you stand must also be authentic to your brand the buying public as well as the gatekeepers of links know when a brand is jumping on a social stance bandwagon its easy to see through a brands thinly veiled effort to ride the wave of the social consciousness theme of the month just ask pepsi about the backlash it received from a commercial that never actually aired on broadcast television a commercial in which a woke kendall jenner walked through a nebulous youth protest only to share a pepsi with a handsome police officer waiting to restore order this commercial garnered a ton of links  but i think pepsi would rather it have never aired based on the headaches it caused for the brands but if you know your audience be vocal about the causes that are important to them dont be afraid to take a stand that your audience will appreciate taking a stand can be somewhat exhausting trolls are real there will be those who oppose your stance that will work to harm you online if you have extremely limited resources to combat your detractors taking a controversial stand might not be feasible no matter how well it will play with your target audience but if you can fight the trolls the links you can garner from taking a stand are well worth the risks once you have taken a stand you arent done you need to create a campaign to let folks know about your stand just like in the last tactic you need to make sure that the important folks know about the stand youve taken again dont play a numbers game with your outreach find the most important folks and make sure they are aware of your stand this list will most likely be different from your other lists as youll want to find the influencers that are particularly interested in the stand you take there is no way to understand how many links your brand will obtain by taking a stand as with anything your mileage may vary one thing i can promise  taking a wellthoughtout public social stand will boost your audience loyalty as well as your links taking a stand isnt for the faint at heart you have to plan it right and most of all know your customers and audience you have to be cognizant that trolls are inevitable and youll need to deal with them but in the end the results are worth the effort timeframe: this tactic is campaign based results detected: in many cases results are immediate average links sent per month: no way to know how many links  varies greatly across issues and verticals tools: no specific tools needed but audience research tools are recommended benefits: image credits

theres a service or product that you use and love write a review or testimonial send the review including your business name and a link to your site giving the company permission to use your review on their website reviews and testimonials are often linked 12 clicks away from a websites homepage so they carry a good deal of weight  even if a company posts your testimonial on their site youre not

use and how to optimize them a captivating headline will draw you in a good opening line Â a hook Â will entice you to keep reading and a wellplaced eyecatching visual will keep you focused and will be remembered long after the words you read have been forgotten not only will images captivate your audience but using visual content is also a practical approach to link building a skyword study showed that content containing related images performed better across all content categories and google is continually working to include more imagery and videos in search changing the way information is presented on a results page this means that you need to change the way you presentÂ your websites information to google and other search engines so you know that visual content is a valid link building strategy but how can you make it work first its important to understand the different kinds of visual content out there heres a quick rundown of some of the key types of visual content you can use to build links to your site: some people think infographics are overused some people swear by them using eyecatching infographics with useful information that readers can understand is still a great way to earn some links though whether you love em or hate em  yes your brands logo is visual content its already in multiple places on your site and it may show up on other websites if youve ever written a guest post been featured or contributed to a community page keep track of the places your logo shows up on the web and make sure its linked back to your site  if youre an ecommerce site or you have an online shop use your product images for link building always use highquality original photos and ensure that all steps have been taken to optimize each image for seo more on that later  dont have products to take photos of try a brand photoshoot from a professional photographer where its you working at your computer if youre an author show off your books in the photo shoot too you can use your brand photos in so many ways for example ive even used one of mine in my own search engine journal author header  yep even the photos from your last company retreat or the employee photos on your team page can be used for link building again make sure these images are highquality and please  spell your employees names right  also known as data visualization charts graphs and maps are a great way to generate links you can even pull these from leading statistics or research make sure the information displayed is useful and easy for readers to understand even without creating an original chart graph or map you can run a report from a thirdparty site take a screenshot of the results and share it as an image in your content remember to share the source of the report if you go this route but the image itself  the screenshot  can be attributed to you  memes and gifs arent going anywhere if you arent using them in your content already it might be time to try use them tastefully and use them well because people love to share a good meme which will mean plenty of inbound links for you to make things really fun and original you can generate your own memes for free at meme generator another type of visual content that is often overused and sometimes wrongly used stock photos can still be useful for link building when done right just dont use anyÂ stock photo choose a highquality tasteful photo thats relevant to your message and adds to the content  ok youve got some ideas for images now lets talk about optimizing those images for seo so that you can get the full benefits of your visual content adding descriptive captions to your images is often overlooked but surprisingly captions get 16 percent more readership than text according to the prsa an image caption differs from the images file name or alt text it is the text that appears below the image briefly explaining the picture many relevant images are understood without captions but that isnt always the case captions add additional context to an image helping both readers and search engines process the information on your page creating keywordrich file names for images is vital to seo optimization your images file name helps describe the image to search engines file names should be short relevant descriptions of the image and should include primary and secondary keywords alt text is the text that appears in place of an image when an image cant be rendered for whatever reason image alt text should be similar to your images file name: a short relevant description of the image including keywords adding alt text to your images can boost your sites rankings by associating your images  and therefore your site  with the keywords and descriptions used sometimes your image will be shared on another site without a link back to your site or with the wrong link there are a couple of tools to help you locate these images like google images and tineye use these tools and when you discover your images contact the publication or blogger thats using them and request that they link back to your site as the source  visual content gives your readers a clearer picture pun intended of what your message is all about as you put your content together think of which visuals to include to clarify and enhance your message try using different types of visual content as a part of your overall

reciprocal links are still used to boost seo and site authority but they can also do the opposite heres what you must consider before exchanging links using reciprocal links  sometimes referred to as traded or exchanged links  was a popular method of link building in the early 2000s but has decreased in popularity in recent years reciprocal links are still a relatively common occurrence theyre a natural byproduct of owning a website after all however the way reciprocal links appear on sites today is different from 20 years ago in my research for this article i found an insightful link building study done by ahrefs which states  and i must agree  that developing relationships through authentic outreach and linking to sources without expecting anything in return are the most proper and natural ways to build reciprocal links this graph shows that only 264 of the authority domains used in ahrefs study are not using reciprocal links:  so yes reciprocal links are still quite common but the question still begs an answer: do reciprocal links help or hurt your seo a link exchange occurs when an agreement is made between two brands to trade links to boost seo and site authority by essentially saying you link to me and ill link to you in essence a reciprocal link is a quid pro quo or a you scratch my back ill scratch yours situation does this sound shady maybe is it shady it could be that all depends on how  and how often  youre using reciprocal links on your site in the third paragraph of this article we linked to ahrefs the link sets us both up for a helpful naturally occurring reciprocal link situation whether ahrefs chooses to reciprocate by linking back to this article is entirely up to them now lets take a look at the other end of the spectrum heres an example of a shady link exchange offer found on a site that exclusively hosts link exchanges:  not very appealing is it if you want to grow your authority and rankings and reduce the risk of penalties from search engines the key is to focus on less risky strategies and tactics above all else your link building methods should enhance your customers experience on your site rather than focusing on serp rankings and your websites link profile focus on providing something of value to your readers and customers by producing highquality content including some external links on your site can be helpful to seo but they arent the driving force behind your sites ranking linking to quality sites that are relevant to your content enhances your readers overall experience on your website content is king and consistently delivering original and valuable information to your readers will earn your site a spot on the throne when you link to highvalue content you can establish your site as a trusted source of information in this case if the other site reciprocates the link consider it a bonus  the content matters first if youre going to request reciprocation check the sites seo metrics to ensure that youre exchanging links with a highauthority website when reciprocal links occur naturally between authority sites both sites may benefit here are a few things to consider before you pursue a link exchange: one example of reciprocal linking that is almost always ok is the use of online directories ensure that the directory is related to your industry or niche and include a link back to it on your own site heres an example of a link exchange between feedspot a popular directory for blogs which are categorized by niche and travel blogger euro travel coach there are some benefits to naturally occurring reciprocal links but when you dont use common sense exchanging links can harm your sites authority and rankings here are four ways that links might actually hurt your seo: simply put reciprocal links are against googles webmaster guidelines if your site is abusing backlinks  if youre trying to manipulate search results by exchanging links  your website runs a high risk of being penalized by google if youre linking to external sites that arent relevant to your content your page might experience a drop in site authority or serp rankings before linking ensure that the content is relevant and check the sites alexa ranking in some cases its ok to link back to lowauthority sites but excessively linking to these sites will not improve your own websites authority when linking to sites with the same target keywords and phrases as your website your chances of having that link reciprocated are low as a result youre only boosting your competitions seo not your own link exchanges or reciprocated links should be between sites with similar content and themes and not between directly competing sites you never want to lose the trust of search engines but reciprocal links can cause this to happen in two ways: building relationships in your industry is a crucial part of any effective link building strategy linking to relevant trusted resources is an excellent way to build trust and authority and develop relationships with brands in your niche by linking to authority sites your site has higher chances of being seen by those site owners which could lead to links from them in the future timeframe: start at month 6 results detected: 12 months average reciprocal links per month: 12 but this depends on the frequency of engagement tools: alexa site info benefits

to: what makes link reclamation even better is that its a process you can start right away at littletono cost unlinked mentions and broken links  while similar  are not the same claiming unlinked mentions is generating new backlinks from online mentions citations images or other references to your brand or company that arent already linked back to your site link reclamation is finding fixing and replacing online content where your brand or company has been improperly linked lost or broken links  also known as dead links  typically occur when a website removes pages or when urls change during a site redesign or rebranding in even simpler terms: unlinked mentions are online references to your brand or company that are not linked to your site they present an opportunity to claim new links broken links are previously existing links or backlinks which are now lost broken these links need to be found and reclaimed for this article well focus on reclaiming lost or broken links fixing internal links is a crucial step to optimizing your sites usability and is the first step in the link reclamation process to find broken links on your own site you have the option to use paid tools like the ahrefs site explorer and deepcrawl or to take advantage of free tools like google analytics and screaming frogs seo spider the seo spider will crawl up to 500 urls with the free version but you can pay to upgrade if you have a more significant site to crawl this example shows screaming frogs free seo spider in action on a sample site:  follow these steps for your own website: if you have a long list of urls with 4xx codes you have the option to export the list as a csv file the next step is to fix your broken links go to each page on your site with broken links and update or replace the urls keep in mind that if you find an old link that cant be fixed  or if you find a link that was forgotten during a web redesign  you may need to remove the link entirely after youve cleaned up

links  whether you can reclaim lost backlinks is up to the other site owner to find broken backlinks to your site you can use paid tools like majestic or the ahrefs site explorer or you can use the free backlink checker from seo review tools youre able to see up to 100 broken backlinks to your site on this report from seo review tools the trick is that after you reclaim those first 100 backlinks you can rerun the report for another 100 backlinks and again and again  now that you have your list of broken backlinks reach out to the site owners to give them the correct links to your website theyll most likely appreciate hearing from you and will be glad to update their page with the correct url after all this is helpful to them too reclaiming backlinks this way is an excellent opportunity to improve seo and build your backlink profile without having to build brand new links images are common sources for backlinks unfortunately images are often another cause for broken backlinks and unclaimed mentions find images to claim using reverse image search tools like tineye or google images  when you upload an image  or search by the images url  a list of matching images appears from sites all over the web:  you can then check each page in the results to see if the image correctly links back to your site if it does then no further action is needed  thats a quality

mutually beneficial relationships mutually beneficial includes peers followers customers and fans linking to your content if you provide real value they will repay you in turn  its that simple the question is how do you start building trust and connections in the first place what should you do off the bat read on if you want to build links to your site first concentrate on creating pieces that are linkworthy this is content people turn to as a known resource for their questions and problems it sounds simple but its harder to pull off in practice thats because few people understand what you need to create highquality backlinkworthy content consider these questions and youll get what i mean: now take these questions and multiply them by the number of posts you want to publish monthly thats a ton of work planning scheduling and strategizing however the sooner you get comfortable with the fact that linkworthy content takes hard work the sooner you can lay down workflows processes and practices to make it easier  remember highquality content covers all of these areas: for an example of linkworthy content look at oli gardner of unbounce he has written masses of great content to grow their brand the best example is a megainfographic the noob guide to online marketing which clocks in at over 13000 words and 15 million pixels this single massive piece has earned thousands of

of greedy boardroom robots trying to wring every last cent out of their pockets engaging with people online can help you do this but there are some other ways to showcase your humanness too: have you noticed a theme here showing youre human is about staying open honest and transparent if you want to build relationships online or off you have to share bits of yourself and remain present rand fishkin talked about this back in 2011 but what he said then is still relevant today: seo at its core is about great content combined with earning great references sharing openly honestly and adding value with that content is far more likely to produce returns in the form of links reputation references and customers than staying closed and secretive bonus tip: remember to build relationships offline too the more people who know and like you only increases the chances that youll earn links naturally go to relevant conferences events meetups or anywhere you can start building relationships think about what you look for when you want to find a trusted source online those markers are exactly what should be gracing your site if you want that trust for your own brand most of us notice these factors unconsciously during our internet browsing sprees but they are key to supporting a trustworthy presence online in addition to great content and an active social presence according to jakob nielsen websites communicate trustworthiness in four main areas:  for a drilleddown look at the trust elements that can make or break your site look at this chart from fishkins article mentioned

out to other trusted sources in your content aurora harley writing for the nielsen norman group blog has some great insights about why your content and online presence need to be linked to the greater web both linking out and in: an isolated website that does not link to and cannot be found on thirdparty review sites social media or news outlets appears to either have something to hide or not be a fully established stable company an unconnected lone website is suspect in other words it vouches for no one and no one vouches for it since the internet is all about interconnectivity its no wonder people and google give sites with no link profile the sideeye in particular linking out to highquality sources does two things for you: the best part about linking out is that its easy to do if nothing else integrate it with creating linkworthy content perhaps the most important takeaway for successful trustearning relationshipbuilding and linkwinning is you cant rush any of it no relationship is built overnight and you cant win trust through one interaction instead a user or customer needs to see that youre true to your word over and over its something that can only happen

baker about the latest news in the industry useful resources attract powerful links heres how you can create useful resource centers that attract links that drive traffic and rankings link building gets a bad rap so much so that many have tried to rebrand link building as link earning however as long as links remain one of the most important ranking factors anyone practicing seo has a duty to engage in link building specifically: link building that conforms to googles webmaster guidelines because link building is hard and links are needed to reach the top of the serps there is a huge black market much of it is blatant including spam emails offering guest posts on seemingly trusted authority sites you also have websites filled with menus of link packages available to anyone with a paypal account private blog networks pbns are the darling of the black hat forums and facebook groups heres the thing google employees get those emails too members of the google spam team are also members of black hat forums and facebook groups google quality raters stumble upon sites selling links regularly for those reasons alone link cheating doesnt make sense and anyone engaged in those activities may be just one link away from tripping the penguin algorithm or drawing a manual action unless you have a burner website it just isnt worth it that said there is no point in making link building any more difficult than necessary having performed every type of link building imaginable there is one method that consistently outperforms all others: creating a resource center and populating it with useful resource pages for clarification purposes: the best resource centers incorporate elements of both this ensures that your site is unique and adds value beyond what is available elsewhere it also increases your chances of being found for unique search queries its best to get started with tried and true content content that has demonstrated the ability to attract links your mission is to identify linkworthy content then improve on it this works particularly well for nonsexy b2b websites traditionally one of the hardest to attract links to the company across the hall from my office trains individuals to become commercial drivers of school buses and trucks they arent one of my paying clients but theyll be receiving some free consulting today as they represent the epitome of a nonsexy albeit b2c business the cdl school could really benefit from having a good resource center on their website the starting point would be a search for cdl and seeing what google suggests  next move onto related searches like:  then continue with even more searches that are related to commercial drivers license truck driver school trucking etc one could also use a keyword research tool for help in developing topic ideas after finding popular topics its time to find linkable content matching those topics my tool of choice for content discovery is ahrefs content explorer there are a number of tools on the market with similar functionality upon entering the search phrase cdl licensing the first result shows links from 502 referring domains  thats a lot of linking domains and this topic looks like it has strong potential for attracting links creating a page like this is worth consideration for the cdl school resource center the next step is to repeat this process phrase by phrase until one has a robust resource center filled with link magnets for content in addition to the tried and true its a good idea to have fresh and bold content a good place to mine fresh content is google trends a search for commercial drivers license turns up the following related topics and queries  if i see a strong trend i dont worry about a contents ability to attract links the potential for attracting links may or may not grow with interest in the topic either way the content still adds value to the resource center by providing information the public has demonstrated an interest in a natural starting point is to mine the links pointing to the original tried and true content there are several free and paid tools capable of doing this every link tool runs their own bots and provide different link info so its best to get link data from multiple sources  the next best source for links resource pages good resource pages tend to link out to other good resource pages use advanced search operators to help find resource pages on related sites two of my favorites are:  can one get a link from the kentucky state police maybe it depends on the quality of the resource as well as the trustworthiness of the website on whole rule number one: never send out a templated link request the conversion rate for link requests is notoriously low to begin with if you want to succeed there needs to be some level of personalization in every request how to prove youre a human rather than a bot: be clear about what youre asking for show the email recipient that you have invested some time in learning about their site Â this could provide added incentive for them to link to your site resource centers provide a perfect foundation for any content marketing campaign in addition to providing a great user experience they have the added benefit of feeding googlebot useful resources attract powerful links the combination of quality content and highvalue links drives organic

internal link building is an integral part of successful seo heres what you need to know when building internal links within your website in the seo industry when you hear the term link building you probably assume the person is talking about external links or backlinks this makes sense after all backlinks from other websites are a strong signal to search engines and a driving force behind organic search rankings but there is another type of link building that is also important: internal link building these are the links you build on your website that point to other relevant pages on your site while internal links arent necessarily what we think of first when we discuss link building they are an integral part of successful seo they even play an important role in delivering roi from external link acquisition the most significant benefit of internal links  in terms of seo  is their ability to direct link equity throughout your website external links bring equity and trust to your website and specifically to the page they point to the page that is directly linked will benefit the most from a backlink but through internal linking you can pass along some of that equity to other pages while the seo value is slightly diminished the further you get away from the externally linked page internal links can provide an option for growing the authority and trust of your lowerfunnel less linkable pages while not impossible its typically difficult to secure links to converting or money pages because these pages usually offer little value and cater to a small audience those who are ready to buy your product however you can overcome this challenge and support organic visibility for these pages through internal links from your linkworthy pages the best part of this strategy is you only need to build the one internal link and your converting page will continuously and progressively benefit from each new backlink you earn to your linkable asset just remember that internal links still need to be relevant your internal link should make sense contextually on the page you place it internal links are a great way to support new pages as well before you launch an external link acquisition campaign for a new page search your site for other relevant pages and build some internal links to give your page an initial boost internal links can also be leveraged to highlight your important pages site structure plays a key role in how search crawlers navigate and understand your website and they use internal links to measure which pages are the most important and most closely tied to your brand the more internal links you point to a page the more important search engine bots will think that page is this can influence which keywords and phrases they will associate with your pages  when there are multiple pages that cover a similar topic search engines will use internal links to decide which page is most important and should show in their search results you want to make it easy for search crawlers to understand your site and which pages are most important to you and internal link building can help them better identify your key pages spiders arent the only ones trying to navigate your site  you can use internal link building to make it easier for human visitors to find the right pages not only will internal links boost the organic visibility of your converting pages but they can also get actual people to those pages to convert seo benefits aside internal link building is critical to ensuring youre providing a solid ux and keeping visitors on your site consider the various entry points people have to your site and use internal links to map out a journey that moves them through your site there should always be a next step or desired action for users  at least until they purchase or convert  and optimized internal linking will help them reach the next destination there are many benefits of internal links but what does internal link building look like in practice to help you implement a successful internal link building campaign on your site lets walk through some of the best practices and common strategies for internal linking you may want to invest in some tools to help you assess your internal linking structure and guide future internal link building screaming frog is a great tool for getting a better understanding of your top internally linked pages using screaming frog to crawl your website you can filter by inlinks to organize urls by those with the most internal links you can also use screaming frog to filter by pages that include a specific term which is extremely useful for identifying internal link building opportunities for example if you are trying to build links to your page about internal link building you can use screaming frog to find all pages that mention internal links to do this you would click configuration custom and then search this will bring up the custom search menu where you could enter your term eg internal links then you just recrawl your site and navigate over to the sidebar and scroll down to custom where youll see how many pages include your selected term clicking on custom will take you to a list of urls that include the term which can be easily exported to excel and voila you now have a curated list of internal link building targets link tools eg majestic moz ahrefs can also be useful as you plan internal link building these tools will tell you which pages on your site have the most external backlinks so youll know theoretically where your most powerful internal links could be built you can also manually review pages on your site as well as internally link based on customer journeys without tools however investing in these tools can help you optimize your internal link structure to receive maximum benefit from your internal link building efforts another aspect of internal link building that should be considered is the anchor text traditionally seo professionals shun exact match anchor text because it can have a negative manipulative effect with external link building however with internal links you want to be as clear and specific as possible about the page youre linking to making exact match anchor text ideal with natural variation included furthermore these links help search crawlers understand your site so you want to use anchor text that is directly related to the content of the page being linked optimize internal link anchor text to ensure humans and bots understand where the link is pointing internal links are valuable for multiple reasons but that doesnt mean you should internally link every page to one another while there is no set number for the appropriate number of internal links on a given page simply use your best judgment for what would be beneficial to someone reading the page if there is an opportunity to place a relevant internal link that would benefit the reader by providing more information or leads them to a page that is the next logical step in their journey on your site then place that link depending on the length of the given page somewhere between five to 10 internal links typically makes sense  again use your discretion and do what aligns with the best user experience most people think of external links when they hear the term link building however internal link building is an integral part of successful seo as well optimizing your internal link structure will help your site in terms of improved navigation clearer content hierarchy and boosted authority for

also filter your searches by region and date use google trends to see what topics are trending in your niche and keep track of any increases in traffic facebook while most of us use facebook to stay

related to your niche pop into facebook groups to see what your audience is talking about or simply stay tuned into what events are showing up on your timeline you may even want to survey your

on your own posts later on reddit can be a great place to find out whats happening in the world of seo business and beyond once you are aware of what topics are currently trending in your space then you can to look out for opportunities to create some truly amazing content doing so goes far beyond simply writing a spinoff of an existing article or even an opinion piece on a current event now is the time to think outside the box rather than scouring the web for ideas the best approach is to start with what you know already  your brand if you are honed in on your brand message and what your audience is looking for recognizing solid content opportunities should be much easier than starting from scratch here are some questions to ask yourself when looking for content opportunities: i dont recommend starting cold and covering a trending topic without doing a bit of research first if you truly understand your audience you will get a sense of what is of interest to them and how to format your content in an effective way the beauty of creating content around trending topics is that it is relatively low risk with potentially high rewards while getting the hang of it may take some trial and error it involves rather minimal investment that being said there are some tricks for creating content that will attract links and boost traffic while the goto for content tends to be blog posts sometimes its best to get a bit more creative think long and hard about what format would be most engaging for the content you hope to put out would a short video do the trick a listicle a funny cartoon the possibilities are nearly endless when it comes to trending topics most times people are looking to get their information as fast as possible you want them to know instantly what the content is about what your main points are and what actions you want them to take the faster they can consume it the more likely they are to share it most of the time when you are crafting a content marketing piece especially for links you will want to tailor it to a unique audience however what matters here is that your content is picked up by a wide range of platforms and is shared at hyperspeed by aiming for a wider audience theres more potential for it to be shared across the web it may not be the most conversionfriendly piece you have put together but the point is that it: with more shares the odds are in your favor adding images videos and more to your content will only up the engagement factor making it more likely that people will share your content this also helps it appeal to people who prefer different kinds of information video written etc also by adding other features to your content you make it easy to repurpose your content for other platforms for example you can share your graphics on instagram your video on youtube promote an infographic via email and more this opens up even more traffic channels obviously if traffic and links are your main objectives you will want to optimize your content for search engines if you arent wellversed in seo yet you can work with a content marketer or seo copywriter to make sure that your content follows seo best practices dont worry if your website isnt fully optimized your goal here is to create content to market across platforms quickly and obtain links in a shorter period of time you can always work to optimize your site later on this should be an obvious point but it is often overlooked it should be super easy for users to share your content as they wish this means making the share buttons accessible on your website including an engaging title and description and setting a featured image for your post you will also want to optimize your content for mobile and even make it available in a variety of formats if possible this makes it easy for users to share your content to facebook instagram twitter pinterest and more once its time to share your content its worth being strategic about what platforms you are going to circulate your content on and how simply sharing a blog post on facebook wont do much to get you the traffic and links you are looking for if social media management isnt your forte again it may be worth working with a content marketing expert to develop a strategy for your content if thats not quite in the budget here is a list of ideas to get you started: keep in mind what platforms you are already active on and which ones your audience is most likely to engage on think creatively about how best to repurpose content into a variety of formats for optimal sharing again this may take some trial and error but eventually you will be able to see which platforms bring in the most traffics and links make a note of this and you will be sure to finetune your approach the next time around using trending topics in your content marketing can be a great way to go viral in your content and boost traffic and links to your website you must be able to stay on top of the trends keep your eyes open to opportunities and then craft content thats made to engage then share it like crazy and watch the magic happen timeframe:Â weekly results detected:Â immediate to 8

industry get our daily newsletter from sejs founder loren baker about the latest news in the industry learn the best practices when using videos for link building and get inspired by some realworld examples of video marketing done right i first wrote about using videos specifically on youtube for link building back in 2010 here is my opening paragraph from that piece: nylon magazine and yes i know that im a bit too old to be reading it has started to put a youtube link in every article in their print magazine its a fantastic way to mix media and use offline methods to promote online marketing jamie oliver sends out emails to his subscribers with video messages in them this goes to you guessed it his youtube channel if youre reading this today that probably doesnt sound like anything too unique does it in fact it seems pretty basic back then it was new now video is everywhere look at these statistics from cisco: its quite clear that video isnt going away as with any content your first step before creating a video needs to be conducting intensive research to see what is already out there its important to remember that you cant measure success simply by the number of links that your videos get maybe a video gets 3 links but gets shared 500 times on twitter watched 5000 times and then 4 people who want to use your product or service come to you after seeing this video wouldnt you call that a success originality will always be one of the main concerns in using videos to build links just like any other content you must consider how to make your videos stand out if you are marketing gardening services and you see that there are 500 videos about pruning rosebushes make a video about the tallest or longestlived rosebushes in the country or make a video series where each video is specific to a region of a country always think about having good lighting and sound it sounds ridiculous to have to remind anyone of that but ive seen plenty of poor quality videos if people cant see you well or the audio is too lowthere are background noises people arent going to sit through it  this is done for you on youtube but you need to ensure its done on your site if youve embedded the video there first lets check a few statistics:   lets look at search engine journal on youtube there are currently 6800 subscribers and hundreds of videos obviously as a columnist for search engine journal im a bit biased but this is some fantastic content as a link builder fantastic content is my dream   videos can be embedded on a site to make the content more appealing each can be used as a resource to point someone to when youre trying to build a relationship that will lead to a link playlists can be created and offered as resources transcripts and timestamps can be added to sites where the videos are embedded each of these videos can appear in the serps in a regular search or a video search when you send out your email newsletter you can point your subscribers to specific videos you can let everyone know that you have a new series you can ask for questions that people would like to have answered in your next video if youre a fan of the skyscraper technique where you find a piece of content make something better then reach out to the people who currently link to the original content video is a great way to stand out a few months ago i was involved with a video where i spoke about old school link building this video is part of an ongoing series with siege media which is catalogued on youtube and on the website for the first time clips of the videos were released instead of just the full thing and they were released weeks apart before the entire episode was released with a video piece you can do the same thing you can do with a large content piece and break it up and market those pieces on their own then do the same thing with the full piece take a look at how this video appears on the site:  there are show notes which reference the discussion we had along with how to follow us on social media the social share buttons are right there there are links to the podcast version of the episodes as well as the brand channel on youtube there are also more internal links to keep a visitor on the site all of this adds up to a great user experience thats an important point to note too when we think about building links with videos it isnt just about getting links to your actual videos thats great if it happens but its more about using videos to generate interest in content that will attract links directly or indirectly ill close with another quote from my original piece: this type of link building wont work with every demographic or every niche it may be a fantastic way to generate more traffic for a fashion site but not a great way to get more traffic to your site about retirement benefits some target demographics just arent really using a lot of social media sites yet thats no longer true from what i can tell just about everyone has realized the power of social media and video its fascinating how quickly things change timeframe: monthly id expect 12 links but id expect lots more social shares in 6 months id

authority building efforts heres how to get a backlink from a local radio station you say radio we say podcasts  but whichever way you swing it the fact of the matter is that there is a hell of a lot of link building potential ill admit it: the decision to not reach out to radio stations because youre working with a pr firm implies a sort of laziness that true link hustlers would capture because if you dont try all the link building strategies how will you ever know which is really the one these types of questions keep me up at night at some point im going to have to admit that it just isnt possible or financially sustainable to test and email every single radio station on the market worth its salt  and ill grieve accordingly so lets start with local radio stations first to be fair this is not a new idea but it is one that link builders often forget and its so simple: email your top 20 radio stations ask to collaborate either on air send products or get featured on their blog its insanely versatile because you can blend offline and online marketing to give your client a new type of backlink result its more than a link building hack  its like having three different link building opportunities in one hit i emailed a local radio station with a full technical seo audit of their site and they mentioned my name and website live on air it was a lifechanging moment in my career and for my websites local seo ive also done a similar tactic for clients by mailing products to the radio stations hosts with a handwritten letter followed up with an email this has typically

got to take your coat to the dry cleaner will you search for: a dog groomersb mexican restaurantsc movie listingsd dry cleaners in seattle ballard i hope you chose option d according to a google consumer study 4 in 5 consumers use search engines to find local information if youre like 80 of the rest of the world youre probably looking for local information online too  turn the tables now

be found on: heres an example of a structured citation on yelp:  unstructured citations are when your business information shows up on a site thats not specifically a business directory you can find

impact on your local seo efforts and on whether your company will show up in the serps local seo and citations help search engines verify your businesss information theyre two of the ways search engines keep tabs on your sites authority and prominence so the more often your companys info appears online the more prominent your site appears to search engines an improved local seo ranking means increased visibility in local search results and more visibility in search results means increased site traffic even unlinked citations can drive traffic and improve local presence but they also provide an opportunity for claiming new links and building your link portfolio local citations help your company establish trust with search engines and with customers if you have multiple websites especially highauthority trusted websites that are citing the same information about your business it tells search engines and your customers that your site and your business can be trusted whitesparks curated list of citation sources by country is a great starting point just work your way through their list to manually build your citations whitespark also offers a helpful local citation finder tool which offers plans for every business  from starter free to enterprise 80mo  according to advice local data aggregators are data mining systems that spread business information online they collect and share business data with a multitude of sources including search engines like google in other words data aggregators gather information on businesses and then feed that information to other sites some popular data aggregators are: googles consumer study says that local searchers are ready to act many visit a nearby location within a day and complete purchases at a higher rate than consumers who conduct nonlocal searches this is why its so important for you to get your business listed in local online directories some directories will generate their listings based on information received from data aggregators check your local directories to see if a listing already exists for your company and make sure the information is accurate you can also submit new listings if one doesnt yet exist for your business  review sites can be valuable sources for citations check review sites for existing information on your company and ensure that your business information is accurate including the address contact information and website customer reviews are a ranking factor that search engines take into account when examining for site authority some examples of customer review sites are: having a social media account for your business not only boosts customer engagement but it also provides an opportunity for citations former googler matt cutts said: facebook and twitter pages are treated like any other pages in our web index and so if something occurs on twitter or occurs on facebook and were able to crawl it then we can return that in our search results so get a couple of social media accounts set up for your business and make sure your address phone number email address and website are correct keep important information consistent across citations make sure your listings have the correct business name contact information and website however keep in mind that small differences here and there are nothing to fuss over for example search engines will recognize search engine journal and search engine journal as the same name as whitespark states it put a little trust in the algorithm still not convinced consider this: googles consumer study found

industry hosting your own podcast or being a guest on other podcasts can be an effective way to earn quality links heres how to use podcasts for link building podcasts have gone from relative obscurity less than a decade ago to one of the fastestgrowing marketing channels available today but the power of podcasts isnt limited to reaching people who are listening when properly leveraged podcasts can have a powerful impact on organic search too there are two main reasons for this this typically leads to links in both directions the website hosting the podcast will usually link to their guests website from the post for that episode the guest and in some cases their fans will link to that episode on the podcast website in other words both having a podcast and being a guest on other podcasts can be an effective way to earn quality links often these links will also drive valuable referral traffic too hosting a podcast is a great way to get your name out there while building a loyal audience its also a great way to develop meaningful relationships with people in your industry i speak from firsthand experience i launched my podcast about a year ago and quickly realized that it made reaching out to strangers a lot easier and significantly more effective we arent going to get into how to launch a podcast that goes far beyond the scope of this article and frankly even though i launched my own i dont consider myself an expert on the topic if you need guidance on that i encourage you to check out john lee dumass guide to starting a podcast our focus in this article will be on how to use your own podcast to earn highquality links the first step once you have all of the technical details sorted out is to create something people actually want to listen to this means sharing useful information rather than blathering on about how awesome you are you might employ a monologue format or as most people seem to do it an interview format the choice is yours but interviewing others is generally a more effective path to earning links its also a lot easier my very first podcast episode was a monologue it was just me talking about the importance of differentiating your company from competitors the topic was useful but i was alone in my office basically talking to myself  and i felt like a complete jackass on the other hand interviewing someone or having a cohost makes it a lot easier and more natural its just a conversation rather than a weirdo alone in a room talking to themselves some great examples of this format in our industry are: whichever format you choose the key is to consistently put out original and valuable information from here its a relatively simple matter of reaching out to people youd like to interview people who have something useful to say that other people want to hear in many cases if you interview someone theyll link to their episode as soon as it goes live without any prompting but you can avoid the uncertainty and simply ask them to do so a good time to do this is right after youve finished interviewing them while theyre still on an emotional high obviously they wont be able to do so until it goes live but youll have set the seed making it more likely when the time comes you can also ask them to encourage their audience to link to it being a guest on other podcasts is a great way to create publicity for both for you and for your company but it can also be a great way to earn links thats because most hosts will link to your website from the episode post most podcasters who follow an interview format are always looking for interesting and knowledgeable guests this means that if you have a particular skill set unique knowledge or an interesting opinion it should be relatively easy to be a guest on relevant podcasts thats assuming that you can pitch your story in a way that makes the host care what you have to say popular podcasters typically receive a barrage of emails asking them to interview people many of those emails are ignored because they are purely selfserving the key here is to pitch from the perspective of their audience rather than your own interests you need to figure out what their audience really cares about and then send a pitch that explains why your story will appeal to them and while youre at it skip the fake compliments and fluff about how you happened to stumble across their podcastÂ everyone knows the compliments are fake and they dont care how you found their podcast instead just keep the pitch short and to the point and dont waste your time with constant email followups if theyre interested theyll reply the only thing youll accomplish by harassing them is making sure they never interview you and if youre particularly aggressive they might even tell other people hurting your chances of getting on other podcasts if you have a large audience of your own maybe from social media a column at a large publication or a podcast of your own it may help to mention that but dont go overboard  a brief mention is enough when you ramble on endlessly about yourself youll turn the host off and kill your chances of getting on the podcast it may be tempting to compile a list of podcasts and sort their websites based on one of the myriads of seo metrics dont while there may be some merit to targeting hightraffic websites youre far better off sorting them by relevance because the hosts will be more likely to interview you beyond that you may want to sort them based on engagement which you can identify based on reviews and social media activity an added benefit is that their audiences will be more interested in what you have to say this means theyll be more likely to listen click through link to your website and even buy your products or services timeframe: this is a fairly simple and straightforward process  compile a list of relevant podcasts and pitch them on you or your client being a guest this could take as little as an hour depending on the niche and how many podcasts you want to pitch some niches may have only a few results detected: you could begin earning links within a few weeks but some podcasts are booked out months in advance so it may take a lot longer they may begin impacting ranking just as quickly depending on the topics you want to rank for and the authority and relevance of the websites the links are on but in most cases you should expect to see a lag time of several months average links sent per month: this will depend entirely on how many podcasts are in your niche and how many you can fit into your schedule after all there are only so many hours in the day and you cant spend them all being interviewed on podcasts most niches will have at least a dozen or so podcasts but certain niches like business or digital marketing could have hundreds tools needed: benefits: image credits featured image: paulo bobita jeremy knauff is the founder of spartan media and brings nearly two

loren baker about the latest news in the industry learn the benefits of using the most popular qa site for link building  plus three ways you can build better links with qa sites opinions vary among seo experts about whether adding links to questionandanswer sites is a valid link building tactic it depends on how you approach qa sites though and how much you depend on these forums for driving traffic the thing is people typically use longtail queries to conduct searches now and are asking questions rather than searching by generic keywords asking a specific question usually returns more accurate and relevant results on serps this is where qa sites or forums come in qa sites are widely used platforms for people to discover new information on a variety of subjects they act like search engines  returning results on a query  but the results could come from any member of the forum people are turning to sites like quora and stack exchange to find answers to questions ranging anywhere from did anyone from your high school become famous to is adding my business link to local business directorylisting good or bad for seo using qa sites as a method of building links helps to diversify your link profile although external links on qa sites are typically nofollow these backlinks shouldnt be discounted be sure to use qa sites with relatively high alexa rankings take quora for example which is ranked 233 in global internet engagement:  provide informative answers to community questions and include a link to relevant content on your site the key here is relevance if you continually add links to unrelated content youll lose members trust and may be viewed as a spam account keep in mind that youre not required to include a link in your answers to maintain trust if you dont have a relevant link dont include a link at all you can also include a link to your website in your user profile present yourself as an expert  or at least a trusted resource  so that when a member views your profile theyll be inclined to check your site qa sites were created to solve peoples problems  much like your product or service which solves a customers problem too right answer questions and engage with topics in your niche market build relationships and gain credibility by being honest and helpful treat qa sites like community forums rather than marketing platforms most qa sites allow members to rank profiles and answers so its important to provide useful solutions and to authentically and respectfully engage with other members as qa sites continue to grow and gain more authority some questions and community conversations from these sites will appear on the first page of serps when you ask an engaging question  or provide a helpful answer  and it gets upvoted youre bringing traffic to that post on the qa site if you happen to include brand keywords and a link to your content it can help boost your sites overall authority and seo in the spirit of diversifying your link profile and improving seo here are three specific ways to build better links with qa sites: using keyword research tools is an excellent way to increase the chances of your content ranking on serps adding qa sites to your keyword research toolbox can help you reach your audience through more specific keywords and phrases look at the difference between the keywords and phrases that turn up when you search for cortado vs flat white on google with the keywords everywhere extension and then in quora:  using these additional keywords and phrases you can engage more effectively on qa sites and provide more relevant links back to your own content use popular searches from qa sites relevant to your brands keywords and phrases as a part of your overall content strategy you can utilize qa sites for content strategy in the same way you use them for keyword research develop a content calendar based on search results and then generate new content that answers specific questions found on qa sites then return to the forums to engage and answer questions using your new content links in addition to performing specific keyword research and developing unique content ideas qa sites can also help you find potential collaborators or guest bloggers stay updated on questions and conversations that are in your niche and request notifications when there is new content related to your brands keywords and phrases interact with members who deliver content similar to yours and develop relationships with potential collaborators guest blogging and collaborating with partners are excellent ways to diversify your link profile and to earn potentially highauthority backlinks as qa sites grow in popularity youll most likely find new sites all the time search for popular qa sites or even for qa sites that are specific to your industry or niche try a few out to determine which will be the most beneficial to your brand and your particular link building strategy here are a few of the most popular qa sites out there currently:  when contributing to and engaging on qa sites think beyond seo you can do more with qa sites than build links and increase traffic use qa sites to develop a more effective content strategy increase brand awareness build relationships with potential clients and collaborators and establish your brand as an expert in your niche timeframe: start at month 6 and

industry there are at least 10 types of bad links that can get you penalized  algorithmically and through a manual action learn what they are and how to get out every seo professional worth their salt knows that links along with content are the backbone of seo links continue to remain a significant ranking factor what happens when you get bad links on enough of a scale to harm your site your site can get algorithmically downgraded by google  or worse you get a manual action while google maintains they are good at ignoring bad links enough bad links can harm your sites ranking this guide will explain 10 different types of bad links that can get you penalized and what you can do about them press release links were popular about 10 years ago these links were super easy to get all you had to do was write a press release and syndicate it to hundreds of press release distribution sites youd quickly get hundreds of links like any seo tactic that worked well it got abused now google considers press release links a link scheme because these are so easy to manipulate you especially want to avoid any press release links that rely on overoptimized anchor text targeting your main money keyword if you absolutely must have a website link due to factors beyond your control use naked urls or branded urls as your anchor text and use only one link from the contact area of the press release to be clear: not all forum discussion links are bad if a link is coming from a good quality site an established user and the link itself is not manipulative or spammy you probably will want to keep it howeverÂ if you have thousands of links coming in from foreign discussion forums they are all lowquality spammy links and they continue to come in you may want to disavow them any links that look spammy wont do you any favors in googles eyes links like these are also manipulative links from foreign guestbooks can be placed manually or with the aid of an automatic program enough of these at scale can cause ranking drops when in doubt disavow think you can fool google by randomizing your footprint just enough so that your spammy link building will go undetected think again it is exceedingly difficult to create randomized footprints that you think google will not detect if you are using an automated program it is increasingly likely that google will find the footprint of that automated program unless it is truly random why the simple act of nofollowing the link is a footprint thousands of links from many different sites that are all nofollowed is an indicator that something spammy is going on pbns used to be a great way to build links to get rankings you could randomize your footprint and all would be well you could continue to see significant gains from using these techniques not anymore now pbns on a massive enough scale can tank your site and cause it to lose organic traffic google is able to detect  and punish  most pbns some pbns may take longer to spot than others but eventually google will catch on social bookmarking links are also considered to be manipulative by google this can get you in trouble if you do it too much think about it they are all manuallyplaced and are spammy as hell its no wonder google considers these a link scheme directory submission services love to tell you that you will get great traction from their links well help increase your google rankings they will say however nothing could be further from the truth submitting to lowquality directories will likely do more harm than good for your rankings as with many things in seo there is an exception it is ok to use relevant and targeted directories for natural link buildingÂ  especially in local seo in fact here are 21 web directories that still have value historically blog comments have been one of the mostabused tactics in seo comment spam is an ancient link acquisition tactic to avoid it does not work in fact you can thank spammy blog comments for the introduction of nofollowed links the goal was to prevent spammers from getting seo benefits from abusing the comments section but there is a right way to approach blog comments the key is leaving topically relevant comments on topically relevant sites this is yet another abused tactic in seo again this is so egregiously bad that while they are not part of googles guidelines the patterns and footprints left behind are likely obvious to googles algorithms it would not be hard for google to set up an investigative protocol to sign up for accounts for these services pose as seos or other webmasters and check out the most common patterns used by these services just always remember  that person youre talking to on the black hat forums regularly could very well be a googler ever heard of tools like gsa search engine ranker scrape box or xrumer sure these tools can build you lots of links however in recent years these programs have become less effective this seo professional does not recommend using these programs for your seo efforts especially not on your money site if an seo can think of it it is likely that google is already several steps ahead with pattern variations already built into their algorithm so far weve talked about links that harm you but could it be something else to find out you should perform multiple audits assess the state of your site and move forward from there from here you will be able to move forward with steps to fix the site if you are unfortunate enough to have a complex site with issues in all three columns you will need to get to work in my opinion nothing beats link detox by link research tools it can assess links from the most sources 25 such as majestic gsc moz ahrefs semrush and many more you will want to compile all links for as many sources as you can get your hands on upload them according to the instructions in link detox once you have done this and you have gone through link detoxs process of reviewing and rating links it will be necessary to prepare the disavow file google has said some interesting things about the disavow file including the following: someoneÂ stated in reddit:recently john muller from google confirmed that bad links can in fact hurt your rankings in some cases to whichÂ john mueller replied:this was specific to links that youve built yourself not about negative seo mueller has also discussed the following: someone tweeted:Â  if i have a medium sized website with lots of local physical branches tens of thousands of backlinks very old website with a 3letter domain that gets linked to a lot by crap websites and 0value directories are those directory links hurting me should we disavow then followed up with:Â  or does it not matter and google knows these websites link to sites like mine for no reason on a daily basis and we dont seek these links out john mueller responded: random links collected over the years arent necessarily harmful weve seen them for a long time too and can ignore all of those weird pieces of webgraffiti from long ago disavow links that were really paid for or otherwise actively unnaturally placed dont fret the cruft did you get a manual action notification just check under manual actions within google search console youll know immediately if google has penalized your site did your site get downgraded algorithmically usually you can assess whether you have an algorithmic downgrade by examining your google analytics data typically youll see an approximate 3550 percent drop in overall traffic this could be to certain pages folders or even sitewide a careful analysis can sometimes reveal other issues eg technical or content on a site that are causing such traffic drops in these cases you should begin with a multitiered audit implementation approach designed to fix contentrelated issues along with linkrelated issues while a full audit isnt necessary checking out the links that link to you could be helpful in general if you see something extraordinarily spammy that lowers the quality of the link overall if you dont its probably a good idea to keep it you need to stop the attack as quickly as possible if you are under high volume link attack its only a matter of time before you will be penalized the process itself is really fairly simple and not overly complex: adopt good habits: in general your link profile should be fairly balanced and types of links should not exceed approximately 20 percent of your overall link profile avoid spammy unnatural links and disavow any against googles guidelines it can take 68 months or more to remove an algorithmic downgrade depending on its severity and if its a manual action you could be looking at close to a year ive personally worked on a 200000 link profile in the legal industry that took over a year to fully get completely reversed and seven submissions of the reinclusion request sent to google dont give up  its possible to repair even the worst of the worst

purchase decisions heres how you can also use them as a link building tactic in just 4 steps most businesses use testimonials and reviews as a way to build trust with their customers and to learn more about what their ideal customer needs testimonials and reviews are also an excellent way to learn what adjustments need to be made to your product or service using testimonials and reviews as a link building tactic however is often overlooked its such a simple and straightforward method which may be one of the reasons it tends to be an afterthought: it seems too easy well yes  it is easy which is precisely why your business should implement testimonials and reviews into your link building strategy not only are reviews helpful to a customer during the decisionmaking process but testimonials and reviews are also an excellent way to establish trust and credibility for your business a study by bright local revealed that 68 of consumers are more likely to buy from local companies with positive reviews and 91 of 1834yearold consumers trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations  with each new testimonial or review you receive search engines will recognize that your website has been updated with fresh and relevant content when your website is updated it provides a new crawling opportunity meaning that your page may rank higher depending on the quality of the new review testimonials and reviews can also improve your chances of ranking for longtail keywords by analyzing your customers comments you can discover new phrases to use as keywords for onsite optimization with each testimonial or review you submit search engines will see your business name and website near relevant keywords and phrases which can help to improve site authority testimonials and reviews provide benefits to three parties: yes the reviewer too  leaving reviews is a link building opportunity writing quality reviews increases your websites exposure and visibility through backlinks or unlinked mentions heres an example of backlinks earned by reviewers of ahrefs:  make a list of products or services you use daily especially in your business consider their relevancy to your company if youre a content agency a backlink on your review of an editing tool will be more useful than a backlink on your review of a new pair of shoes if your review will be published on a companys website another thing to consider is their domain authority or alexa ranking not every company provides a space for submitting reviews directly on their website if there isnt an onsite location for submitting a review check the companys contact information to locate an email address review sites like yelp and foursquare also provide opportunities to review and rate companies although theyre not as personal if you use a review site be sure to include your business name and website in your profile you also have the option to share a review on your own site in the form of a blog post create an authentic review with a good deal of personalization offer trust and authority and use a few relevant keywords in your text having keywords and phrases near your business name in your review can increase your companys relevance to those keywords during search engine crawls and boost your exposure online for your brand name heres a unique way to create a review that wasnt just text but ended up being a cool little video example of how we use a certain software app every day for example if you google my agency express writers around the bottom of page 1 youll find that we submitted our bot toÂ drift as a testimonialÂ of how much we love their live chatÂ software and use it on a daily basis i built a bot with a playbook called the write bot pen name pen pal that earned this feature from them this not only won us anÂ indexed keyword high up in google for our brand name but we even have a link on their site  if theres a product or service that you particularly love consider taking it one step further share your review or mention the company in a blog post on your own site and include a backlink now its time to reach out to the company be sure to include your business name and website when you submit your review to provide the opportunity for a backlink to your site if the company doesnt link back to you theyll probably still include your business name thats helpful too because even unlinked mentions can be beneficial if you wrote a review or mention in your own blog post be sure to include a link to the post when you reach out to the company you can even use an excerpt from your content as the official testimonial  building authentic businesstobusiness relationships can be a challenge when you write testimonials and reviews  or mention a favorite product or service on your own blog  keep it genuine and personable newer companies especially will appreciate this gesture to continue to develop your relationship follow and engage with the company on social media when your review is published share it on your own social media channels and tag the company in this example carl pullein a time management and productivity coach mentioned the popular productivity app todoist in his content todoist retweeted carls post on their account:  establishing trust and building relationships with other businesses provides further backlinking opportunities a company may even consider collaborating in the future having seen your enthusiasm for their product or service and trusting your company to provide genuine and valuable insight testimonials and reviews are an easy and effective way to build quality backlinks and improve your websites authority and visibility as a bonus writing or requesting testimonials and reviews isnt nearly as awkward as some other standard link

about the latest news in the industry get our daily newsletter from sejs founder loren baker about the latest news in the industry creating valuable content but not getting credit for it heres how to turn linkless mentions of your brand into links unlinked brand mentions are mentions of your brand on published sites that do not provide a link back to your website backlinks are critical in developing website authority especially within relevant communities while google does give value to brand mentions even if they are unlinked links provide far more seo value as the primary offpage ranking signal as seo experts we know that links can provide the value you need to be recognized as an authoritative trusted and relevant site the recognition through links from toptier publications is what will lend credibility and authority to your website this is why we want to take action when we see a mention that is unlinked there is a simple solution to these unlinked brand mentions: ask for the link having already mentioned your brand it indicates that they find value in your product service or perspective and want to share that value with their audience this places you in an advantageous position to ask for the cherry on top below is a stepbystep approach to finding these unlinked mentions of your brand and reaching out to the publisher to generate a highvalue backlink use a tool to scan the web for unlinked mentions of your brand you want to find all the links that will add value my personal favorite is semrush buzzsumo is another helpful resource to discover social shares of your blogs or mentions of your website make sure to scan for all potential variations of your company eg search engine journal sej searchenginejournal this will ensure that no mentions are missed in addition to searching for the brand name you can search for any branded products tools or assets also try searching for employee names as the ceo might be referenced in an article with no link expand your search by scanning for alternate spellings of your brand name as your search tool will not catch misspelled branding once you have compiled a list of unlinked mentions next you must prioritize based on the highest seo or pr value if you have a wellestablished brand you might find thousands of unlinked mentions though you can manually attempt to capture a link on all of these websites the optimal strategy is to prioritize the most authoritative websites you can use your judgment to assess authority ie have you heard of the website would you be excited to have a link there but there are also objective metrics to assess authority moz majestic and ahrefs have their own metrics to quantify url and domain authority use these metrics to help prioritize which unlinked mentions are worth the outreach effort the ideal contact would be a sites webmaster especially if there are external links in the article but none leading to yours for whatever reason if you cant find the contact email for the webmaster on the sites contact page try performing a site search for the keyword webmaster for example google search  site: https:wwwsearchenginejournalcom webmaster note that this could result in many results and may prove frivolous you can also use linkedin to zero in on the webmaster or someone in a related position next find either the author of the article or the website editors contact email to reach out if youre unable to find any of the previously mentioned contact emails then use the general information email or standard contact form find a reason it would benefit the webmaster to take the time and effort to insert a link word your request in a way that they can clearly see that linking to your website will not only benefit you and your brand but also provide value to them and their audience as well sometimes internal pages are easier to link to than to your homepage for example if theres a webpage blog post or service page that covers the topic of discussion on the page youre trying to acquire a backlink on it might make more sense to request a link to that specific page instead when asking for the link be cordial and thank them in advance for their time you want to avoid coming off as pushy if its an article compliment it in a unique and genuine way also be sure to thank them for including youyour company in the article explain how adding the link will provide additional value to their audience if the link hasnt been added and you havent heard back always make sure to follow up only stop once you hear either a yes or a no at the same time dont harass them either its a fine line to walk if you spam them daily with the request theyll be less likely to want to do you this favor your first followup should be after a few days between 3 and 5 then after a week and a half then every few weeks it might also be that the email youre using isnt being monitored so see if theres an alternative contact email you can use track your outreach efforts in a spreadsheet you never know you might be able to build a relationship with the more enthusiastic respondents and possibly earn a guest post or featured article if your company goes through a rebranding or if you migrate your website to a new domain it is important to update your old links andor branded anchor texts map out and implement 301 redirects from your old domain to your new one otherwise your oncerobust backlink profile will be scattered with broken links while redirects are good theyre not as impactful as a direct link reach out to all of the quality domains that link to you and request they update the link majestic is a helpful tool to find these links to the old domain provide any material they might require as well logo new company name etc its easy enough to convince the website to update the brandingbacklink appropriately as youre pointing out an error on their website having dated information and having broken links is bad for their site health as well lets say a wellrecognized publication mentions your brand without a link you have been mentioned by this trusted source however the recognition ends there ideally this mention will have a link to your website as well which helps to build awareness amongst relevant users while this unlinked mention does provide some benefit to your company this fourstep link building tactic allows you to leverage this recognition since google relies on backlinks as a primary offpage ranking factor all in all backlinks will determine your brands reputation and give your target audience relevant information  its a winwin timeframe: this should be a quarterly process results detected: the results can vary however once a publisher agrees to provide the backlink it can take on average a week to

your resources on these 18 common link building tactics google has been whittling away the value of links since the beginning of the search engine the reason google chooses to ignore certain kinds of links is that those links do not represent a true recommendation as far back as 2005 i was told by a googler at a conference qa that google depreciated links from pages that are irrelevant like from a footer powered by link thats an example of google removing irrelevant links from what they count as a link signal for ranking purposes a true link signal is when a publisher links to a webpage because it is relevant to the topic and therefore useful what all of the following tactics have in common is that they do not result in a true link signal this is from a patent about historical data that covers inbound links outbound links how fast links are acquired how often content is updated and so on one of the factors that are relevant to link building has to do with adding links to a page without the page actually being updated google is on record stating that just because something is in a patent or a research paper doesnt mean its in use additionally the older the patent the higher the possibility that another algorithm was developed that made it obsolete that said we dont know whether something like this is in use its something to take note of this patent is called information retrieval based on historical data google has snapshots of the web including snapshots of the state of the linking patterns the most common and easily detectable mistake is adding a link to an existing webpage this patent dates from 2003 matt cutts then head of googles spam fighting department is listed in the patent as one of the authors thats a good sign that this patent has a strong antispam component among the various things this patent covered one of them was tracking changes of links on a webpage: this patent covers a wide variety of changes to links on a page and links to a webpage heres a sample of the things this patent covers the section below discusses identifying how new links that are associated with a document are and assigning scores weights relative to the newness of those links and then using those scores to rank a webpage 26 assigning weights to the links based on the determined measure of freshness and scoring the document based at least in part on the weights assigned to the links associated with the document 27 the method of claim 26 wherein the measure of freshness of a link associated with the document is based on at least one of a date of appearance of the link a date of a change to the link a date of appearance of anchor text associated with the link a date of a change to anchor text associated with the link a date of appearance of a linking document containing the link or a date of a change to a linking document containing the link now this section of the same patent discusses issuing penalties first it discusses determining time based link information claim 54 and in claims 55 and 56 it discusses penalizing rankings based on time related link patterns 54 a method comprising: determining longevity of the linkage data deriving an indication of content update for at least one or more linking documents providing the linkage data andadjusting the ranking of the linked document based on the longevity of the linkage data and the indication of content update for the linking document the next section claims 55  56 are subsections to claim 54 above the following part describes how google can alter ranking scores with time based link information: 55 the method of claim 54 wherein the adjusting the ranking includes penalizing the ranking if the longevity indicates a short life for the linkage data and boosting the ranking if the longevity indicates a long life for the linkage data 56 the method of claim 55 wherein adjusting the ranking further includes penalizing the ranking if at least a portion of content from the linking document is considered stale over a period of time and boosting the ranking if the portion of content from the linking document is considered updated over the period of time what that section appears to cover is obtaining links from content that hasnt been otherwise updated link selling was a multimillion dollar business in those years prior to penguin around 20072009 google was able to identify which links were paid and began devaluing them i know this because an executive from a link selling business told me that many of the links they sold were increasingly no longer working there were multiple theories of how google was catching links added to pages that werent otherwise updated in retrospect something like the historical data patent could be used to easily spot paid links in addition to other paid link signals the importance of the patent i cited is that google monitoring historical link information is possible there is a solid basis for the possibility the patent shows that its possible that google could detect paid links by monitoring the inboundoutbound link changes within a domain over time webpages change all the time but there are some rates of changes that dont happen on normal sites so a site thats selling links from within existing webpages could have the power of those links penalized adding links to previously published articles in an attempt to influence google may backfire a person reported to me in early 2019 that he purchased links from an existing page and his page lost rankings within two weeks was it the fact that the page was an old existing page that was not updated or was it something else its hard to say im just putting this information out there for your consideration the offer a discount link building technique can result in a penalty dont do it this is an example of a sketchy link building tactic offering something in return for a link is a paid link overstockcom was reported to be penalized by google in 2011 for offering discounts to university students in exchange for links  overstockcom apparently was offering university discounts in exchange for links to their product pages a university published a pdf document with discounts that were intended for students unfortunately for overstockcom the document apparently contained the text of the outreach with instructions for how to link to the overstockcom product pages the pdf doesnt exist anymore but archiveorg has a snapshot of it here beware some seos are still recommending discount link building as you can see from the link above this tactic violates googles guidelines and if that matters to you then dont do it this is another variation of a paid link the interesting thing about this tactic is that it can actually be illegal because it may violate ftc rules against publishing reviews that have been paid for with products samples or other compensation the official guidelines are here: ftc  guides concerning the use of endorsements and testimonials in advertising an easy to read faq about endorsements is here: ftc  endorsement guides: what people are asking this is not about guest posting this is about a different form of content marketing content marketing is a lot of things a valid version focuses on publishing articles on ones own site to establish the site as a thought leader and create a useful resource that generates goodwill and links another version of content marketing is hiring a writer to publish an article on a third party website with a link to the client from within the article these kinds of article links do not typically contain a disclosure that a payment was made to the writer for the article and the link this is advertising when money or other consideration is exchanged for a link that is considered an advertisement done for promotional purposes this may violate the ftc guidelines cited above a relevant section is here: your spokesperson should disclose her connection when promoting your products outside of traditional advertising media in other words on programming that consumers wont recognize as paid advertising the same guidance also would apply to comments by the expert in her blog or on her website the following ftc guideline states that if the advertisement cannot be disclosed as in a hidden arrangement then that advertisement should not exist if a disclosure is necessary to prevent an advertisement from being deceptive unfair or otherwise violative of a commission rule and it is not possible to make the disclosure clearly and conspicuously then that ad should not be disseminated this means that if a particular platform does not provide an opportunity to make clear and conspicuous disclosures then that platform should not be used to disseminate advertisements that require disclosures viral link campaigns can be useful a viral link campaign can be useful if it is highly targeted to the demographic of people who would become purchasers and results in links from relevant webpages in my opinion some of the value in viral link campaigns lie less in link creation and can be in awareness building building awareness for a company has value the more offtopic a viral link campaign is the less likely it will result in relevant links in that scenario there is no value for ranking or awareness building a viral link campaign is useless if the reason people are linking has nothing to do with your core business model or your keyword phrases viral contests and other forms of viral stunts for links tend to result in irrelevant inbound links google discounts irrelevant links the page andor the immediate context of the link must have a meaningful relevance to the site being linked to if the relevance of the link is for the topic of the viral campaign then those links may help rank that site for that topic a friend shared with me the anecdote of a company that ran a campaign for their real estate company the campaign was a contest to about the worlds worst real estate agent portrait photograph for years afterward the real estate site failed to rank for meaningful phrases but it did receive a lot of traffic for phrases like worlds worst real estate agent now imagine bloggers and news organizations linking to a toy retailer website because the toy retailer created the worlds biggest teddy bear all the links have the context of the worlds biggest teddy bear the landing page theyre linking to is the viral link page about the worlds biggest teddy bear that site may rank for the worlds biggest teddy bear but those thousands of links will not help that site rank for their important search queries because none of those links come from the context of a specific toy nor do they link to a specific toy so how can that site rank for yoyos when all their links are about the worlds biggest teddy bear it wont they never do i gave a presentation at an internet marketing conference several years ago and one of the audience members was confused at why his wildly successful viral link campaign failed to increase rankings and sales the above description is why irrelevant viral link campaigns fail in terms of creating a lift in rankings and sales dont overlook the value of building awareness with a viral link campaign viral linking as a strategy can be useful just dont expect an offtopic viral campaign to result in a change in rankings while were on the topic of viral links this is a strategy that no longer works this strategy dates back to the days when digg was popular the scheme was to build a ton of viral irrelevant links to a viral link page then months later take the page down and do a permanent 301 redirect to the home page or to a product page this no longer works and hasnt worked for many years google will not assign pagerank or relevancy signals through a redirect or canonical if there isnt a one to one relevance between the two pages in my opinion it is very unlikely that a philanthropic event will generate links from a meaningful context this is similar to a viral link campaign the best links are from a context thats related to your topic to a page on your site that is about that topic this kind of link is convenient and expedient thats why some seos recommend them theyre easier to acquire which is good for the link builder and not so good for the client its not really the kind of link that will move your rankings i say this from personal experience i and others experimented with these around 14 years ago this is nothing new they simply do not move the dial on rankings and if thats not good enough for you heres what googles john mueller said about charity sponsorship links in a webmaster hangout: if with your website youre sponsoring different clubs and sites where it looks like the primary intent is to get a link there then thats something the web spam team might take action on so id try to take a look at the bigger picture there and think uwhether or not this is really something that youre doing systematically like going out and sponsoring other sites or products with the intent of getting a link or if this is something thats essentially just a natural part of the web pagerank and link ranking algorithms look at how the web interconnects google builds a map of the internet then likely creates whats called a reduced link graph consisting of mostly nonspam links and pages then as part of the ranking analysis it organizes the web into neighborhoods by topic scholarship links are great if your goal is to rank for keyword phrase  scholarship the problem with these kinds of links is that they have an irrelevant context most sites that do scholarship link building arent about scholarships theyre about things like personal injury lawyers  there is no relevance between a link from a school to a personal injury lawyer for the purpose of ranking for personal injury lawyer search phrases the link is relevant for things like personal injury attorneys scholarship google will rank these kinds of pages for those scholarship search phrases and that is the extent of the value this is useless for business owners because the links arent about their business theyre about scholarships if a personal injury lawyer attained links that are relevant for the search phrase pizza restaurants they will rank for personal injury pizza restaurant but a pizza restaurant link is not desirable for a personal injury lawyer website the same kind of relevance problem applies to scholarship links an seo may say that a link from a edu will help increase the domain authority of a page that it will increase trust and that dot edu links are special thats wrong in three different ways i think were done with scholarship links now lets move on to an even more useless link building trick one of the oldest and out of date link building tricks around is the badges link building strategy the badges for links strategy is a variation of the awards strategy as well as the widgets strategy the idea is to create a fake award then award to websites that will display your image badge that proclaims them a winner the trick is to give them the badge and the code which contains a sneaky link back to your website run as fast as you can from any seo who tells you the badges trick is a useful link building tactic this link building strategy is so stale that if you breathe on it itll crumble and blow away the badges link building technique is similar to the widgets technique which google explicitly called out in 2016 its similar because in both cases the link builder is giving something of value an award a visitor counter and forcing the link back to the original website the tactic relies on people linking to your site for reasons other than your content those kinds of links have been devalued since at least 2004 when google stopped passing pagerank from pages that are irrelevant to the page theyre linking to the idea is to create an awards page and have the badge link to that awards page the idea is that the link will pass pagerank since the context of the link is similar to the context of the webpage one of the failures of the badge for links strategy is that unless your site is about awards the link is useless all its going to do is help your page rank for keywords  awards how does that help you it doesnt blog commenting is such a bad link building tactic that the search engines created a link attribute called nofollow in 2005 should anyone really consider a tactic that was already burned in 2005 even though the nofollow attribute is now a hint thats no excuse to start comment spamming like its 2004 does anyone believe google would make the nofollow into a hint without being able to handle a 2004 link building tactic buying a website is an edgy tactic redirecting the domain in order to parasite the link signals doesnt work anymore the reason is that google will not pass link signals from one page to another unless the pages are a close match creating a separate website only doubles your work because now youre link building and content writing for two websites this is a variation of the sponsorship link building tactic the problem with this tactic is that the links are irrelevant an seo will try to convince you that domain authority trust and dot edu magic will help a site rank better but those excuses have already been documented as untrue this is a variation of guest posting only worse content syndication is creating content and letting others publish it in exchange for a link former google engineer matt cutts warned the seo community in his famous post about guest blogging called the decay and fall of guest blogging for seo this is a variation of viral link building it creates a situation where other websites are linking to a site for reasons that have nothing to do with the relevant topic offtopic links are never good widget links are one of the oldest forms of scaled link building many years ago in the early 2000s the top ranked site for mesothelioma was a lawyer site that distributed visitor counters for universities to use at the bottom of their webpage placing the page counter code resulted in a link to the lawyer site it worked for years and then it stopped working when wordpress gained popularity many people started using other forms of useful widgets for people to add to their sites plugins for things like a weather display news rss feeds and other useful functions were created so that they resulted in a link back to someones site google formally published a blog post to warn against this technique press releases are useful for announcing important news about a business the value is in a news organization publishing a news story based on the press release the value is not in the links embedded in the press release sites that syndicate press releases tend to be of low quality google may also choose to ignore the links in duplicate content because its painfully obvious that links in duplicate content do not represent the quality of being a true link signal googles john mueller is on record as stating that press release links are something google tries to ignore so if common sense and logic arent enough to convince you that is a lowquality tactic then perhaps a googlers statement will as the moderator of the link building forum at webmasterworld and being friends with many forum owners i can tell you right now that online community administrators know about link builders who sign up to a forum in order to drop a link from their profile just dont its a lowquality link with zero context and zero relevance its not a true link a forum profile link is about as useless and spammy as a link can get there is zero context for a ranking signal to a webpage its silly to consider such a link as a link building tactic in my opinion anyone who recommends this tactic has a credibility problem forum administrators and moderators are on the lookout for link builders who post a couple useless me too posts and then answer a question with a link to another site saying and theres more information at this site sorry but most forum admins and mods consider that spam the mods will trip over each other to delete those kinds of posts if you want to publicize your business in a way that puts it in a bad light and generates buckets of ill will have at it powered by links in the footer stopped working over fifteen years ago just stop being fashionable is about going along with current trends like fashion link building tactics have many trends sometimes driven by how easy they are when it comes to link building its good to understand the history behind certain tactics its also useful to understand how search engines use links knowledge will help keep you from making avoidable mistakes  dont let anyone tell you that knowing about patents or research is useless knowledge is useful understanding how search engines treat links can save you from needlessly tanking a websites rankings there are so many ways that a link building strategy can go wrong these are in my opinion a few of the link building

latest news in the industry your social media profiles are important for online visibility and helping grow your network which can lead to more inbound links heres how using company or personal online profiles to generate links is a tricky subject some people think it is spammy or misleading especially when someone creates profiles for the sole purpose of getting links even though a few shady marketers have twisted the purpose of profiles it doesnt mean you cant do it in a genuine way it is possible to have real profiles that share your information background and accomplishments while also using it for more than just a way for people to find you online having online profiles on the main social networks and websites your core audience visit is not only important to online visibility but it can help you grow your network which can organically lead to more inbound links for your content below are five of the best ways to use profiles to help get quality links connections made with a real person get higher engagement and provide better trust than the same activities done with a company profile many online users have learned to ignore messages and requests from brands on social networking sites simply because there are just too many companies on there trying to get users to buy their products or share their content personal connections continue to matter it is possible to use network building as a way to share content on an individualized basis but it does take some work to grow the relationship first some digital marketing teams log into executives personal profiles to add friends or connections or to followup with existing contacts to help build relationships this helps executives get to know others in the industry which can lead to a reciprocal relationship of sharing and promoting each others content however while this seems like a good way to offload some of the social networking it can have a lot of potential drawbacks if the executive doesnt know what was said and then happens to talk to the connection in person or on the phone or even in email it can make them seem disingenuous and untrustworthy if a team is helping an executive with their social media make sure they are still involved in the process most people are on the basic social networks like linkedin and facebook but there are many more niche networks and forums that are commonly used daily by those that are deeply involved in a certain industry try to find these online communities and get more involved youll find that there is often more depth to the questions and discussions leading to a lot of good opportunities to build trust and get others interested in your content provided its useful to the discussion at hand some sites to check include: because these are highly technical forums it doesnt make sense to go in and start spamming discussions with your links try to integrate with the community by answering questions getting involved completing your profile and staying active before even attempting to share your own content when you share your content make sure its actually useful to other users otherwise you may find yourself being ostracized for trying to commercialize the discussion when possible ask your executives to get involved with your online activity or set up a sharing schedule with their permission to regularly share content on their personal social media profiles linkedin is the perfect platform for this as executives can have their own profiles and can share content as needed because executives have more personal credibility their link suggestions are much more like to be taken seriously by users than a company profile simply sharing links to their blog the executives profile is vouching for the content making it more trustworthy when possible ask executives for their insight or commentary on an article that can then be shared with the link users like hearing the opinions of influential or high profile people so adding this personal touch can help increase interest linkedin is great for building personal credibility and sharing content but you can also use twitter forums and facebook to do outreach and get others interested in your content on twitter and instagram its a common practice to follow people in your industry you hope will follow you back taking the first step toward building a relationship can help get you noticed organically and hopefully start a relationship after following someone send them a tweet mentioning something they did recently such as podcast they were on or an article they wrote this can show that you admire their work people are much more likely to take an interest in someone that they know already appreciates what they do  because it doesnt feel like they have to win them over  its already done building genuine relationships with influencers or authorities in your field can be a fulfilling way to not only grow your online visibility but to also learn from some of the best minds in the business as these influencers and authorities begin to trust you you can ask them about sharing your links or if there is a way you can continue to help one another promote new ventures and projects wordstream founder larry kim is a master at getting tons of traffic to his content and he has shared in presentations and in blog posts how this strategy has lead to big gains he even did a webinar about this topic for sej essentially with the right targeting and even as little as 50 you can get your content in front of the right people on facebook when you have clear and concise targeting the ad spend is lower and the user interest is usually a lot higher try to target exact interests or industries eg manufacturing vps in the us instead of simply users who have an interest in business and make sure your content title and description shares exactly how it is useful to the people youre trying to target as the ad garners more visibility youll see a trend in natural links as well as users who see the ad share the content with their own networks this helps it grow organically making your ad budgets stretch much further getting shares and links for your content using online profiles and personal outreach certainly isnt the fastest way to build links but it is one of the most genuine and usually has the greatest longterm impact as you grow your network youll find that people are more likely to share content from people they know like and trust by focusing on building your online profiles by staying active sharing interesting and relevant information and promoting the work of others youll find that it often comes back to you in a big way timeframe: 1020 forums per month results detected: it will likely take more than 30 days to see the first round of links come in but typically you will see results with link building in 36 months depending on a large number of factors average links per month: the number of links should depend on how

about the latest news in the industry get our daily newsletter from sejs founder loren baker about the latest news in the industry doing something thats actually newsworthy can help you gain publicity boost your authority and earn links heres how to do it right public relations and link building go together like chocolate and peanut butter but in order for pr to play an effective role in your link building efforts it requires the right approach that means you need to first have a story that from the audiences perspective is worth telling but just because youve got a great newsworthy story it doesnt mean that youll earn links in fact many news publications make it a rule to use the nofollow attribute or even not to link out at all in some cases this isnt a reason to not use this approach though because coverage in trusted publication especially one with a large audience carries value that goes beyond the potential link as a result of other people seeing the story there you may earn valuable links from other publications and we already know that search engines often ignore the nofollow attribute that being said once you have a newsworthy story youll have to pitch it to the right people at the right time in a way that makes the value to their audience immediately and clearly obvious unfortunately a lot of people try to take shortcuts here these shortcuts might include: doing these things will not only ensure that you dont get any coverage or links but it will also ensure that your future emails tweets and dms get ignored it might even ensure that you get beat like a piata and youll deserve all of those things ok so now that weve talked about what we should specifically not do lets talk about what we should do this part of the conversation should be a lot more fun and perhaps less painful first well start by doing something newsworthy the first and most important thing you need to know here is that the term newsworthy can be both objective and subjective so what makes something newsworthy the criteria might depend on: in other words like most things in the seo world it depends but for the sake of example some things might include: the iphone when it first came out was a perfect example tesla was another but you dont have to invent some cool new hightech gadgets to leverage this approach in fact your invention can be boring and lowtech provided that it solves a specific problem roof max recently did this when they announced their invention of a solution that when sprayed on a roof extends its life while inventions like this arent generally seen as cool compared to those in the tech world they are definitely newsworthy because they solve a big problem for a lot of people to get the most from this approach youll need to invent something that solves a specific and important problem ideally for a lot of people people are tribal you need to look no further than a typical debate on facebook to see that but this isnt anything new people have this mentality because it has played a critical role in our survival that makes leveraging tribalism a powerful way to earn media coverage and often links one great example of this is the annual military influencers conference which gets a ton of media coverage because it provides an opportunity for veterans to network while both learning from and mentoring fellow entrepreneurialminded veterans there are several ways to specifically impact a specific group just know that when you take this approach you will turn some people off thats ok though because thats an important part of building a passionate audience a milestone could be a lot of different things: the thing is in order for anyone to care it will have to be something objectively significant like the largest real estate deal ever in your city the greatest number of people employed in your industry or the fastest growth in the country one example is sourcetoad which was recently included on the inc 5000 list thats a significant milestone in and of itself but the fact that its a relatively small local company helps to get local media particularly excited the downside to milestones is that they get old pretty quickly you can only yammer on about your achievements for so long before people start to tune out or worse yet start to cheer for your failure doing something thats truly newsworthy isnt going to happen overnight anything that would warrant positive media coverage will generally require a fair amount of work to achieve that means weeks months or even years of work but thats ok because it also means fewer of your competitors will put forth the effort there are also a lot of smaller things you can do in the meantime that can result in publicity which may lead to links this might include: remember the ice bucket challenge just about five years ago you couldnt go anywhere on social media without seeing someone dousing themselves with ice water in increasingly ridiculous ways the als association used this to generate awareness and encourage donations to help fight als amyotrophic lateral sclerosis this earned them countless media mentions social posts and an enviable number of links while you may not have the budget media contacts or as powerful a story as the als association you can still leverage an event  physically or digitally  for charity which you can use for your pr and link building efforts the key is to find a charity that you are actually passionate about because there is no faking authenticity next youll need to genuinely help them to raise money and donate money yourself we talked about authenticity earlier so youll have to put your money where your mouth is ive seen many military organizations do this for children of veterans but you can offer a charity based on any criteria you want that might include: and the scholarship doesnt have to cover the entire tuition personally i would aim for a few thousand per recipient when you offer less its not really going to help anyone and its obvious that youre doing it for selfserving reasons this can be created for or tailored to certain groups of people in the same way i described in the section on scholarships its important to actually provide substantial value here though a mistake i commonly see is offering a trivial discount just to tie the promotion to a particular group such as veterans teachers or law enforcement i dont know about you but when i see a restaurant offering a 5 discount for veterans it doesnt make me say oh they must really love us  look at the discount theyre giving just because i served on the contrary even as bad as i am at math i can immediately see that the discount here is nothing to be impressed by if you want to really get peoples attention  and the attention of the media  make a bold offer something like veterans eat free on veterans day thats the kind of thing that the local and in some cases national media love to cover and it doesnt have to be a discount a promotion can take a variety of forms if youre a parent you already understand the madness that comes with halloween excited kids revved into a sugarfueled frenzy by every kind of candy imaginable are roving the streets in search of even more candy add to that the fact that its nighttime and these kids are often wearing masks that make them oblivious to whats going on around them and you can see why some parents would love an alternative churches daycare facilities and some other local businesses have been known to host a halloween trunk or treat where kids can more safely trick or treat in their parking lot these events also typically have bouncy houses games and other entertainment to wear the kids out and ensure they have a good time its important to make sure your business is relevant or at least appropriate for kids though no matter how pure your intentions might be holding this type of event in a strip club parking lot probably isnt going to earn your business any positive media coverage or links once youve done something newsworthy the next step is to find and pitch the right people at relevant publications wait  you mean people arent going to sing my praises for my valiant effort in a word no im sorry but 90 times out of 100 no one is paying enough attention to your company to notice anything youre doing so its up to you to get your story in front of the right people that means pitching contributors editors producers and other relevant media contacts everyone wants to be featured in large national media including news networks like cnn or fox or business publications like the wall street journal entrepreneur and business insider but that generally isnt going to happen for many businesses its generally going to be more effective to approach smaller publications first these publications might include: for television and radio youll generally want to pitch your story to the producer  not the anchors or hosts but its important to find the right producer for the program you want to be featured on while this information may sometimes be difficult to find there are a few ways to dig it up in some cases the producers name may be mentioned in the program or listed on the website in other cases you may need to fire up a search in google or linkedin and a third option is to simply call and ask its often easier to track down a contact at print publications and websites since the editor and contributors are usually listed prominently editors are typically listed at the front of magazines and can be found somewhere on most websites while contributors names and often contact information are included right in the article once you know who you need to pitch youll need to craft your message in a way that makes you stand out theres a fairly easy way to stand out: care about the audience a lot of people make the mistake of pitching their story from their own perspective rather than from an editors producers or contributors perspective which all come down to the audiences perspective if you put your own needs first youre almost certain to be ignored on the other hand if you can demonstrate why their audience would find your story valuable theyll be significantly more receptive to your pitch youll also need to keep your pitch short everyone today is busy and they arent going to read a long email from a random stranger skip the fake compliments and elaborate stories about how you stumbled across them its disingenuous and theyll see right through it instead explain why your story will appeal to their audience within a few sentences timeframe: this could take just a few hours or it might take significantly longer it just depends on how elaborate your plan is for example inventing a new product might take years while offering a scholarship is instantaneous then you have to factor in your time to find and pitch the most appropriate people at relevant publications follow up and track your results results detected: links can start to show up immediately but it may take anywhere from a few minutes to a few days for google to find them they may begin impacting ranking just as quickly depending on the topics you want to rank for and the authority and relevance of the websites the links are on but in most cases you should expect to see a lag time of several months average links sent per month: stories with a niche or regional interest might acquire only a few links while stories with a broader interest could generate hundreds or even thousands of links and in some cases despite your best efforts and a great story you can still fall flat thats just the nature of the beastyou cant control the news cycle nor can you control editors producers or contributors tools needed:

the kind google wants you to build but anything worth having is worth working for right so lets talk about how you can start creating linkworthy content linkworthy content is simply useful contentÂ linkworthy content typically comes in four forms: ultimately you want your content to be the best answer to a question being asked by someone in your target audience if youre like me when youre writing content you have no intention to creating a final product that nobody wants to link to however theres no denying theres a lot of mediocre content on the web most content fails to gain any traction  few if any views shares or links creating awesome content that attracts links isnt easy this is quite sad considering thatÂ 719 percentÂ of marketers are focused on creating content according to search engine journal research the content competition is fierce youre competing with blog posts infographics videos and so many more types of content for attention and clicks all too often great content fails or is outperformed by something inferior why because it wasnt marketed properly think of content as an asset just like a rental property or stocks your content has the potential to generate valuable links that will help your seo but creating linkworthy content is only half the battle if a piece of content is published on the web but nobody links to it does it make a difference you can create and publish amazing content but if nobody can find it its all wasted time and effort unfortunately great content doesnt guarantee you links thats why you need to establish relationships with influencers when you work with influencers you arent just adding one more person to your network youre also adding their entire network any influencers you work with should be a natural fit it makes sense for your audience and the influencers audience a recommendation from a true influencer can instantly make your content more appealing to a whole new audience influencers may have a loyal following on social media twitter instagram etc they mayÂ run a blog or website or they may be a journalist when it comes to identifying influencers think in terms of quality not quantity

publications and consequently drag links along with them links remain one of the strongest currencies in seo despite many years of people claiming otherwise but getting ones that carry value is becoming increasingly difficult as google continues to get better at understanding which links are manipulated purely for seo so its becoming more important to get good links that will move the needle on your performance how do you do that by not thinking about links at all if you take a step back and approach your link building activity with a more general marketing hat on then you start to look at ways that naturally drive links along with it we use traditional pr approaches to gain coverage for clients on top publications which then drag links along with them even without it being the first thought and weve come up with approaches that work time after time to build strong sustainable link profiles for clients that drive seo performance over the long term want to know how we carry out a variety of pr approaches for clients from press releases to reacting to journalist requests that land in our inbox but the thing that allows us to gain hundreds of links in one fell swoop is our creative pr campaigns these involve coming up with creative ideas that make our clients stand out pitching them to relevant journalists and watching the coverage roll in one of the key difficulties many people have with their pr is that they just pitch the regular qualities of their client which dont make them stand out from all their competitors who do exactly the same thing to get coverage you need to offer something unique or new that warrants being written about what if your client doesnt have anything new or unique to write about thats where we come in so how do you come up with ideas that journalists are going to love and write about well you look at what theyre already writing about its as simple as that identify the publications that you want to be featured on and then scour them to get familiar with the kinds of stories they cover it might be: the main thing is that it sets you apart from what others are doing while still following the pattern of stories that the publications like covering once youve come up with your idea you need to implement it so you have something to show when you reach out to a journalist they can smell a pr stunt a mile off so this needs to feel genuine even if it is created with pr in mind and if your stunt is good enough then theyll cover it anyway for us this might mean adding a new quirky tour to a clients website publishing a blog post with details of a competition and how to enter or creating a page on our website with the results of a study weve done this is important for two reasons: you didnt really think we werent considering links at all did you step 2 here is the crucial part in increasing your chances of getting links from your campaign if you give them a url which readers have to visit to enter has tcs or includes key information that needs to be read then they are far more likely to link to it otherwise youre just hoping they link to your homepage as the source and i hate hoping once you have your content in place its time to put it in the right hands outreach is where seo professionals become better at pr than pr people many people believe pr is all about your little black book of contacts ignore them pr is about giving the right journalists the right story at the right time it doesnt matter if theyve never heard from you and dont know you from adam if you give them a great story they will cover it so how do you find those people if theyre not in your little black book you use link tools of course remember when you were scouring your target publications for story ideas well if you take those story examples and put the source into your favorite link tool then it will tell you exactly where the story was covered and who covered it do this for a variety of different stories with the same theme and youll end up with a long list of extremely targeted writers who have written about something similar so are highly likely to write about you once youve been through and sent your story to journalists its time to sit back and watch the coverage roll in but be realistic each one wont hit the mark you might only get a few bits of coverage or even none at all you cant control the news cycle and even the best researched and planned out pieces dont land however if you stick with it and carry out this process multiple times i would bet my house on it bringing in great results for you some examples to give you an idea of what you can achieve: this shows you the process works there are many more like this all you have to do is follow it it really is as simple as that timeframe: we carry these processes out over a quarterly period for clients which is a reasonable timeframe to have in place though it could be done more quickly if it was inhouse for example results detected: links acquired immediately ranking impact seen around 12 months after coverage started to come in average links sent per month: in this example we gained around 150 links but this can vary from project to project some do fantastically well others bring in 1020 links and sometimes they dont take off at all tool needed:Â ahrefs benefits of using this link building tactic: image credits

sejs founder loren baker about the latest news in the industry get our daily newsletter from sejs founder loren baker about the latest news in the industry want to know how to establish yourself as a thought leader in your industry and get quality links in the process this guide can help over 56 million blog posts go live every day thats more than 233000 per hour and despite only about 20 of the worlds population speaking english 66 of that content is in english thats a lot of competition for users attention one way that you and your content can stand out in such a crowded space is by earning your place as a thought leader a thought leader is one of a few goto people in their field of expertise they are the type of person who is frequently quoted in the media and who many look to as a trusted source of information not only does a thought leader inspire with their innovative ideas they can show people  stepbystep  how they turned those ideas into reality but you cant merely brand yourself a thought leader and have it be so  its an honor you need to earn when you do your content will rise to the top of peoples considerations where it can be consumed rather than lost among the 44 million other blog posts pushed out on any given day on your path toward becoming a thought leader its important to remember that its about what you think and believe not about what your company does thought leaders are innovators in ideas as well as in application if you want to establish yourself as a thought leader to sell more stop people who earn the title do so by educating and empowering others in their field its more about building your reputation and trust with your audience clients and colleagues than anything else there are various strategies you can use to establish yourself as a thought leader within your industry if you want to know how to get quality links with thought leadership consider: the vast majority of commercial blog posts are churned out by people who arent experts in the field theyre writing about but rather experts in creating seorich content they are gleaning what they can from other blogs and bolting it all together in a package that sells what they are not doing is diving into any raw data to derive truly unique conclusions if your goal is thought leadership you dont want to be like these people instead of reworking material that is already out there you need to bring something new to the table  often with the quantitative data to back it up one way of doing this is by teaming up with research firms to design studies buzzsumo and sparktoro are two companies that do this well another is to dive into datasets that are already out there developing your own conclusions from what you see no matter how you do it bringing innovative ideas and new insights to those working in your field will help you become a thought leader much faster than regurgitating status quo content starting a podcast is a great way to attract links while developing your reputation as a thought leader podcasts that follow an interview format are perhaps best for this purpose as they are the easiest to produce and every time you interview a guest theres a good chance that theyll link back to their podcast feature on your website another positive aspect of starting a podcast is that it gives you space to challenge ideas with other experts and develop theories that can be built on in the future when youre invited to speak at an event youre well on your way to being considered a thought leader however youll still want to build links to cement your place in the industry  not everyone is going to be there to watch your presentation one of the best methods for building links via speaking events is creating landing pages for every event at which you speak the landing page should include details about the event itself as well as slides optins downloads and other resources when youre creating resources for the event focus on developing them so that they work as valuable standalone content as well  you want them to be linkworthy from there make a push for a link from the organizers website a direct link is often included with your bio on the website however you can push for a more profound impact by writing relevant blog content specifically for the organizer and the event while planning what to say at your speaking event you will want to use your position to act as a company spokesperson  like when john mueller answers seo questions additionally be quotable by repeating fundamental takeaways as quotes on your slides youll be able to get your point across and make it easier for people to link back to your work to help facilitate backlink building consider hosting your slide visuals directly on your website if you want to get in on the event scene but public speaking isnt your forte you can also look at building links by opting to sponsor an event the easiest way to do this is to create an event listing on your company website and submit it to directories local news and all relevant pr people when reaching out to those at news outlets its worth testing the waters to see if they would like to do an interview about what to expect at the event  another great backlink building opportunity where you can add value for your target audience webinars are a fantastic mix of a podcast and public speaking events to get the most traction with your webinars youll want to keep them between 30 and 40 minutes long this time includes the recommended amount allotted for a live question and answer session at the end you absolutely want to have that because thats what most webinar attendees want as part of your webinar youll want to include engaging slides as well as optins downloads and other resources its almost exactly the same idea youd use for creating content based on a speaking event of course even if you dont create any additional material besides the slides for your webinars people can link directly to a replay on your website building links by becoming a thought leader requires you to actually become a thought leader which is a title you have to earn  not one you can award yourself for marketing purposes if your thoughts and beliefs are strong and clear you can get there it isnt about what you or your company does but about why you do it also dont forget: you dont have to be the ceo or founder of a company to be a thought leader anyone within a business can offer insights worth sharing as a simple example you dont just hear from googles ceo you also hear from representatives like danny sullivan and john mueller each person is a thought leader who has influence you will want to approach becoming a thought leader by genuinely wanting to educate and help others in your field by taking this approach all the effort and work that goes into launching podcasts webinars and public speaking events will make sense on top of the direct impact all of these methods will have they will all also help you develop terrific content that people will want to link to as a trustworthy source timeframe: for this tactic to really work youll need to be consistently creating new content and getting it in front of relevant audiences on a weekly basis results detected: as early as one month after implementation average links sent per month: theres a direct positive relationship relevant to the amount of work you put into original research or the uniqueness of your content tools needed: you wont need any fancy tools to make this tactic work  its all about the content that said depending on the tactics you use youll probably want to invest in podcasting and webinar tools screen recording and video hosting tools may also be useful benefits: image credits featured image: paulo bobita maddy

rosesandchocolatey feeling than this: by julia mccoy it gets even more romantic when my blog and name are featured in a prestigious site thats what guest blogging is all about fame reputation success but its more than that in fact you can use guest blogging as a powerful strategy in your linkbuilding toolkit ready to dive in guest blogging started out beautifully it was like having a famous singer appear at your local theater or having a highly acclaimed author write the introduction to your book but like a ton of other seo practices things went awry people began jumping on guest blogging as a spammy tactic to gain coveted backlinks heres an email googles matt cutts received in 2014  this email shows you exactly what went wrong with guest blogging also it tells you how not to do it guest blogging isnt about slapping your name onto a piece of sloppily written content just to get those quality backlinks so what is good about guest blogging today lets go back to the concert analogy youre a rising singer with spectacular talent and a unique style however theres a problem: not many people know about you how do you get people to notice you the answer is by singing as a guest at a famous singers concert you get an invite you go and wow the crowd with your vocal acrobatics after youve impressed them you subtly ask them if they want to see your own concert singing as a guest does two things for you: guest blogging is no different when you write an authoritative highquality post in a wellknown blog with thousands of followers people will notice you theyll even start coming to your own blog but it doesnt end there when people discover your blog and see that youre doing something theyve never seen before they will link to you heres some inspiration before we dig into the how of guest blogging larry kim posted 40 amazing places to learn something new every day on inc if you look at the post its useful inspirational and downright enjoyable to read the result it got more than 40 backlinks so now lets dive into how you can become the next star guest blogger and earn yourself your own collection of quality holistic links guest blogging isnt about making a list of the most successful sites today and pitching to all of them if you want success you need to follow the correct guidelines pitching to one authoritative site thats right for you is better than pitching to 100 authoritative sites that are wrong for you heres how to narrow things down choose a site in a similar niche if you are in the content marketing niche itll do you no good to guest blog on a fashion site yes readers will enjoy your post if its wellwritten and entertaining but they dont need your services so the chances that theyll check you out online are slim review the sites performance  after youve narrowed your search down to a select number of sites within your niche check to see how well each one is doing online these pointers indicate the site may be a good choice for your guest post: make sure youll get a featured bio even if youve been a huge fan of a site for years never pitch for a guest post if you wont get a featured bio you want your byline a headshot and a link back to your site for readers to follow if you find out that youll be posting as a ghostwriter or simply a guest run  unless all you want is bragging rights of course imagine yourself pitching to a magazine like the new yorker according to the write life you have a 00000416 chance of getting published in the magazine so what do you do you do all the required research then create a pitch the editor cant ignore its easier to get a guest post at a prestigious site than to get your story into the new yorker still it requires the same work ethic and skill follow these steps to increase your chances of winning that guest post do your research spend quality time on the site you want your guest post to appear take note of the kind of blogs they post which topics get the most attention is there anything missing that you feel you can address in a blog of your own pitch to a person instead of a website if you sound impersonal and generic you will be ignored guest blogging is a relationship its connecting with real people and forming lasting ties for example i started my column at huffington post by directly emailing ariana huffington dig in deeper check out who else is guest posting on the site read their posts and visit their sites become a detective dont ignore the guidelines for pitching not paying attention to guidelines will get your pitch deleted without being read be direct get straight to the point with the owner or editor of the site dont bombard them with a cartload of details they dont need instead outline what you can give them in a few concise succinct sentences show them you value their time tell the editor or owner about yourself  listing your own sites credentials is a good idea no one wants links to lowquality sites on their blog also blog editors and owners want to know who theyre working with creating your pitch is tough but writing the guest post itself is even tougher here are some tips thatll make your writing resonate with readers know what your audience needs people dont read for fun unless its literary fiction of course they read because they need something maybe they need information they can take action on a service thatll make things easier for them or an inspiration to impact their dull boring lives your mission is to find out what that need is when you do youll be able to craft a guest post thatll suck your readers in and have them chasing your sites link take a look at this example article in international living  people read international living because they want to get insider tips on retiring abroad in style one problem many of them face is trouble with banks and brokers so when they see this article they read it people will read your post if you address their needs its that simple catch readers with your headline when people read your headline they decide whether or not theyll continue with your post look at these examples of two headlines that address the same topic headline number one:  headline number two:  as a reader youd likely pass over headline one and click headline two why headline one is generic and uninteresting the lowercase letters rob it of professionalism headline two on the other hand has a huge promise for you when you click youll learn six essential proofreading skills plus it uses power words like perfection polish glossy and sheen  if these words dont make you picture clean shining perfect writing i dont know what will go indepth with your content your content shows your readers who you are when you guest post dont merely scratch the surface of your topic dive in and dive deep show your authority and expertise here are some tips to help you dive deep into your topic provide content thats easy to digest  the average reader will run when met with a long block of unbroken text since you dont want that follow these three steps for easily digestible content when you guest post youll be given space in your biography section to add a link although you might be tempted to link to your homepage dont do that instead think of the outcome you want to achieve through the link do you want readers to sign up for your email newsletter check out your online store follow your blog choose the best way you can get your product or service out there then link to the page that gives you that outcome guest blogging isnt putting your content out there and then forgetting about it its engaging with people on a real personal level so when readers comment on your post leave them a reply answer their questions and engage with them by showing youre active youll be able to increase your conversion rates and put yourself front and center in readers minds once your beautiful wellpolished content shines on a site with thousands of followers the results are easy to predict readers will come flocking to you you will be recognized as an authoritative expert your blog will gain its own crowd of followers and of course youll gain your own quality backlinks timeframe: ongoing starting

in the industry get our daily newsletter from sejs founder loren baker about the latest news in the industry when a brand takes a social stand they get links read on and find out if link building through social responsibility is right for your business a number of years ago i conducted a rather ambitious research project to find out how consumer preferences were affected by a brands social stance while i certainly didnt conclusively answer whether a brand should take a stand i did come to one concrete conclusion:  a brand that takes a social stand almost always sees an seo benefit from that stand for most companies taking a social stand is difficult taking a stand means that a portion of your audience is not going to agree with you  usually the most vocal portion no one likes to have people calling for boycotts to your products or services the resources required to respond to unhappy customers who disagree with your stand can be astronomical theres definitely a lot of think about when taking a stand but the old adage say anything you want about me just spell my name right is apropos to the search engine optimization results of a brand taking a stand when a brand takes a social stand they get links period both sides of a social cause will link to a brand that is taking a stand those against the stand will link to the brand to make other likeminded individuals aware of a perceived atrocity those who support the brands stand will link to make likeminded individuals aware of a brand that supports their worldview from an seo standpoint the brand wins the links garnered from a social stand are almost always quality links i would argue that one of the easiest ways to get links from major media sites is to take a significant social standÂ this works especially well if the social stance you take is unique taking a stand is not the same as jumping on a bandwagon for instance if your company takes a stand supporting the metoo movement dont expect to get a ton of links even though taking that stand is morally the right thing to do your stand is not going to mean much from an seo standpoint if you take a unique stand  say for instance declaring that your company will not allow certain medicine to be bought using employee benefits eg hobby lobby youll get press and youll get links quality links seo does not live in a vacuum for years we were siloed as those people who mess with the website code to be successful the seo team must have a seat at the table when deciding whether a brand should take a stand marketing must be heard  and that includes seo time after time brands that understand their audience are more successful when taking a stand the best example is chickfila while the company didnt intentionally take a stand against samesex marriage the remarks of its founder put chickfila firmly in the crosshairs of the debate despite numerous calls for boycotts of the restaurant sales skyrocketed and the number of links the company received was astronomical  some estimate more than 50000 highquality links dont get me wrong i certainly dont agree with chickfilas stance but their core customer did and the company was rewarded for it taking a stand can also backfire look at the foundationÂ susan g komen the organization took a position against planned parenthood this angered many loyal donors susan g komen certainly benefitted from a lot of links from major news sources but the seo benefit wasnt enough to stem the tide of revolt to this day the organization is still working to win back an audience they lost over a controversial social stance so how do you know whether to take a stand making this decision is an area where the seo team should shine its all about the data how well can we know our audience what is the overall opinion of our customers on the stance we are looking to take this is the same type of research seo professionals do every day when putting together campaigns you can provide the data for the decision makers this makes our role as seo pros and analysts extremely important in any equation regarding corporate responsibility and social stances a recent yougov study found that 59 of americans would boycott a brand for its political stance this number is even higher among millennials our study found that geography makes a difference in how consumers react to a stance for instance: in addition we found that women are more likely to care about political stances than men also the younger the consumer above age 18 we dont have data for minors the more likely they are to be conscious of a brands stance it is increasingly popular for brands to take both political and social stances but it is not a decision that should be taken lightly the benefits of taking a stance that resonates with your core audience are immense taking the wrong stance can be devastating to the bottom line the key is knowing your audience this is easier for small business as your audience is usually easily understood for enterprise companies this decision can be much more difficult thats why its important for all companies to get the analysts and seo pros at the table digital data is the best source we have for understanding our audience so use it dont be afraid to take a stand but do it right the benefits are vast even if the risks are harrowing timeframe: this is an ongoing tactic results detected:

competition curve and lg seems to have done just that if you were wondering just when you can hang this seethrough beauty on your living room walls you may be disappointed to know that lg is not

saving hugely on bandwidth i really like this subtle effect on the fortuitous blog the text at the bottom of the page fades away even as you scroll the page content up and down it can be a mighty cool effect to have images that nestle themselves in the four corners of your webpage you can achieve this positioning with css fairly the graphic design blog asks an interesting question about advice for beginners on learning csshtml: should newbies learn static or dynamic web design hey yall  i have a guest post up over at cssjuicecom explaining how to set up userselectable stylesheets check it out i say variable because css doesnt natively support real variables the debate is somewhat heated on whether it should or not im not going to take a its a bit too early to tell but as you may have noticed

windows only quick web reader delang was having trouble with the css page loader concept i posted a while ago so i went and made up an example page its very simple and it i read a comment the other day over on css drive from someone named slackerbabe that i thought was worth repeating heres a cool way to remember the order sometimes the best way to get inspired to design is to look at other great designs these designs showcase beauty and function over flashiness there are one the techniques i have advocated using for a long time is this:   margin: 0 padding: 0  this is part of the css reset theory which helps keep blockquotes are html elements that are meant to designate when a particular section of text is being taken from another website or other source different this is how you create a super basic submit button: all you need to do to replace this default button with an image is to change the type to image and often times tag clouds use variations in fontsize and fontweight to distinguish between heavy use and light use tags here is another approach: use for many people their introduction to web design and the wonderful world of css is through blogging they start off blogging because its so easy and you defining colors in css is all about hex codes you know those alphanumeric sixdigit things like 990000 you might have a handful of them memorized recently i posted about a little trick about remembering the css anchor selectors now i have another little trick that is even more useful using the i found this hilarious ie voodoo doll over on deviant art what an awesome way to take out your aggression you cant buy them of course copyrights amazoncom has been flogged a few times for its weird use of tabs in its design that dont really act like tabs well now we can start flogging it for there is some very nice software out there for creating and editing css files since im mostly a mac guy this review is mac focused but i would love to there is discussion about making rotation part of the css3 here are some important points: there are two types of rotation: rotation that happens during polishing your website nice overview about the subtleties and details of web design and how those details are what makes great websites honeypot i really like it when pages use really subtle animation to enhance different page elements check out the ejunkie site and their little flame dude in the ive been thinking a lot about screen resolution lately and how the use of fluid width websites is the best way to accommodate all visitors screen jared schwager has an interesting idea on compressing css onthefly using php works pretty well the end result is slightly quicker downloads and what is remote linking remote linking is a rollover that affects another object on the page the rollover can affect itself as well this can be done sometimes looking at other sites is all the inspiration you need here are some nicely designed sites that i feel stay focused on functionality as well nice article from 456 berea street on maintaining the quality of your markup once you pass a design along to a client it advocates the use of big red ive touched on the sliding doors theory here a little bit before but never with a fullblown example if this is the first you are hearing of it i did another guest post over at cssjuice on a technique using the same background image for different objects on a page along the lines of the perfect good web designers spend a lot of time making their pages accessible one way to think about accessibility is to think about the extreme case scenario of bye bye blogrush i really wanted to give blogrush a healthy try so its been in the sidebar here for over a month if not two they have just released im not sure this is the best way to go about this or not but the need arose for me to do this recently and this is how i did it this tutorial is the winner of the css menu maker iphone contest was announced the winning entry is really nice i entered that sliding doors example i did a while ago first of all what is page size page size refers to the sum of all the elements it takes to render your page that includes the html file the css reader brian left a comment recently with what i thought was a really cool idea: i was thinking it might be neat to have a floating div with the random matthew mullenweg of wordpress clarifies his thoughts on a wordpress theme marketplace im all for it foohack has a nice post up on 5 problems with i wrote a guest post over on tutorial blog about taking control of image rollovers in the tutorial i show 5 different techniques for image rollovers why bother most people know how to print a web page so including a print this page button on a website is often overkill but there are some since i published my article on using css in html emails a few days ago there has been a couple of great articles published on the same subject i want if you come from a print background at all one of the things you might sorely miss is the concept of tabs for example think of a restaurant menu with more power comes more responsibility one of the things that css allows you to control is the hover state of many objects most notably anchor the typical technique for making a fluid width layout is to have your main content have a minimum and maximum width and then make sure it is working in check out the statistics for the screen resolutions of all you hip kids who read csstricks: on this site 800x600 doesnt even make the top ten knowing someone over at digital inspiration asked the question: how can i send a youtube video so that when the person receives it there will not be any other just like you can validate your html at the w3c you can validate your css     csstricks passes muster has your css ever been acting funny on you but it looks as if youve done everything perfectly it just might be your html declarations that are screwing   margin: 0 padding: 0  this has become a very popular technique lately and for good reason it removes all default margin and padding for every here are some simple styles you can use when you need a big header h1test1  fontfamily: georgia sansserif fontsize: 5em letterspacing: 2px  this is kind of a links of interest post but i wanted to highlight these things extraspecially: a preview of html 5 i know everyone and their mother is here is the deal: you gotta test in ie you dont have to use it you dont have to like it but you have to test in it but which version do you test in ordered lists are boring sure you can apply background images and do quite a bit of sprucing up to a regular ordered list but you just dont get enough keep your list items inside there is quickie css trick over on free css templates reminding about the liststyleposition property and how you use it to note: this should only be used for the powers of good dont go around stealing peoples background images and using them on your own site without asking i wrote a guest tutorial over on web designer wall detailing how to create an allexpandable box this is a box that will expand both vertically and so what do we really have here as far as variety of font choices things are pretty bleak but helvetica isnt on pretty much every computer in the link value factors wiepnet has a really interesting and comprehensive

monotheistic religion which worships one patriachal allpowerful god the holy book of christianity is the bible from the greek word biblios which translates to book although technically the bible is not one book but indeed 66 books there are many different denominations of christianity and it is incredibly hard to estimate how many christians there are in the united states because there is no common belief on what defines a christian the most liberal view of everyone who says they are a christian being a christian would place the figure around 75 whereas the considerably more conservative belief that anyone outside your own denomination is not a christian can place the figure as low as 01 denominations sprout from the original idea of christianity because some phrases from the bible contridict each other and thus to harmonise this people say phrase a is literal whereas phrase b is symbolic however one group might say a is symbolic but another might say b is symbolic thus there are now hundreds of different denominations preaching slightly different versions of effectively the same source material unfortunately as christianity is the big religion of the western world it gets a lot of negative press however like all groups christianity has the best and worst among their number the christians who get the most press are the ones who give the stereotypical image of never doing anything wrong and sitting on streets shout repent or go to hell or something similarly pleasant however many christians  most in fact  are decent people who just want the right to practice their own religion like everyone else or the right to not practice a religion in the case of some someone who displays intelligence in an annoying way a battery powered device that emits a flavored

in real firefight in cs the awp is often considered an overpowered weapon because it has ability that no other weapon has  it kills with just one shot almost anywhere in the targets body excepting only legs and arms if a limb is hit the player has 1519 hp hit points left it is also the only weapon that kills with a headshot hit through an obstacle if the target has a helmet buyingusing of awp

sniper can totally change way the match is moving as example very good ct sniper can cover a bombsite so effectively that the terrorist team either cant even reach the site or they can do that but with a large descrease of their count in my opinion the awp isnt overpowered its just easier to use for lowskilled players than the other weapons beacuse such people are not able to score a headshot so the awp offers them to override their lack of skills however if they encounter an agile player every at least midskilled one they usualy cant hit him anyawy awp is also very expensive in clanwars

sight pieces of shit in general all the worlds horrors all the things and people you dispise and dread most compacted into one building  noun global economic collapse in the usa this began in 1929 and persisted to 1939 most other industrialized countries emerged from the depression earlier during the great depression unemployment reached over 25 in the usa and those who had jobs suffered severe wage cuts the index of industrial output fell over 53 from its high in july 29 while trade and capital markets plummeted to mere fractions of their former levels what happened  many people imagine that the stock market crash oct 29 and the great depression are the same thing however it took another three years for employment bank failures and declining industrial output to run its course in 1929 the usa had 25000 banks by 1933 10000 had either failed or been merged with another to avoid failure at this time there was no fdic so depositors mostly lost their money another phenomenon was plunging prices: the consumer price index fell 25 during the first four years for businesses this was a disaster and forced them to lay off millions the great depression made farms in much of the southwest unviable ruined farmers fled to california or washington and their abandoned farms succumbed to the dust bowl this was the single largest ecological disaster in recorded history how it happened  there are basically three main explanations for the great depression 1 during the 1920s there was a huge and growing disparity between rich and poor the incomes of the great majority rose much more slowly than productivity but this was masked by increased borrowing people were able to borrow because the market value of their assets was larger than what they owed but when a rash of defaults occurred then the market value of assets plummeted and people owed more than their assets were worth businesses had to lay off workers which further reduced aggregate demand 2 the great depression began as another minor downturn but was made much worse by the failure of the federal reserve to respond adequately see milton friedman  anna schwartz while the fed reduced interest rates prices fell even faster so real interest rates soared this made a quick recovery impossible 3 the financial markets combined with fed supervision distributed capital badly for example speculative
